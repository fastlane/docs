# Jenkins Integration

## Installation

The recommended way to install [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) is through [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```no-highlight
brew update && brew install jenkins
```

From now on start `Jenkins` by running:

```no-highlight
jenkins
```

To store the password in the Keychain of your remote machine, it is recommended that you run _match_ or _deliver_ using ssh or remote desktop at least once.

## Ruby Environment
We recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) for installing Ruby, though [rvm](https://rvm.io/) and the version of Ruby that comes bundled on macOS are fine too.

If using a Gemfile in your project, add an "Execute shell" step as your first build step and call `bundle update`.

## Plugins

You'll find the following Jenkins plugins to be useful:

(note: We do not recommend installing the Xcode plugin)

- **[HTML Publisher Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HTML+Publisher+Plugin):** Can be used to show the generated screenshots right inside Jenkins.
- **[AnsiColor Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/AnsiColor+Plugin):** Used to show the coloured output of the fastlane tools. Donâ€™t forget to enable `Color ANSI Console Output` in the `Build Environment` or your project.
- **[Rebuild Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Rebuild+Plugin):** This plugin will save you a lot of time.
- **[Keychains and Provisioning Profiles Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Keychains+and+Provisioning+Profiles+Plugin):** Manages keychains across Jenkins installations.

## Build Step

Add an "Execute shell" build step using your appropriate _fastlane_ command per the example below:

```no-highlight
fastlane appstore
```

Replace `appstore` with the lane you want to use.

(note: if using a Gemfile, prefix that command with `bundle exec`)

### setup_jenkins

You can use `setup_jenkins` action which integrates well with the [Keychains and Provisioning Profiles Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Keychains+and+Provisioning+Profiles+Plugin). Selected keychain will be automatically unlocked and the selected code signing identity will be used. Also all build results, like IPA files, archives, dSYMs and result bundles will be stored in the `./output` folder in the job workspace. In additions `setup_jenkins` will create separate derived data folder for each job (in the `./derivedData`).

Under the hood `setup_jenkins` configures other actions like: _gym_, _scan_, `xcodebuild`, `backup_xcarchive` and `clear_derived_data`.

### commit_version_bump || git_commit

You can use `commit_version_bump` or `git_commit` action to commit changes to your repository in your fastlane setup. When you are using webhooks to trigger your build on a push this will cause an infinite loop of triggering builds.

#### Gitlab

When you are using Gitlab you will need the [GitLab Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitLab+Plugin). Inside the job you want to configure you go to `Build Triggers > Build when a change is pushed to GitLab > Enable [ci-skip]`.
When you include `[ci-skip]` in your build this commit won't trigger the build in jenkins at all.

**Example**  
```ruby
build_number = increment_build_number
commit_version_bump(message:"[ci-skip] Version Bump to #{build_number}")
git_commit(path:"./CHANGELOG.md", message:"[ci-skip] Updated CHANGELOG for Build #{build_number}")
push_to_git_remote
```

## Test Results and Screenshots

To show the **deployment result** right in `Jenkins`

- *Add post-build action*
- *Publish JUnit test result report*
- *Test report XMLs*: `fastlane/report.xml`

To show the **generated screenshots** right in `Jenkins`

- *Add post-build action*
- *Publish HTML reports*
- *HTML directory to archive*: `fastlane/screenshots`
- *Index page*: `screenshots.html`

Save and run. The result should look like this:

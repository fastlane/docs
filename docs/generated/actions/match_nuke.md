# match_nuke


Easily nuke your certificate and provisioning profiles (via _match_)




> Use the match_nuke action to revoke your certificates and provisioning profiles.<br>Don't worry, apps that are already available in the App Store / TestFlight will still work.<br>Builds distributed via Ad Hoc or Enterprise will be disabled after nuking your account, so you'll have to re-upload a new build.<br>After clearing your account you'll start from a clean state, and you can run match to generate your certificates and profiles again.<br>More information: https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/

## Documentation

To show the documentation in your terminal, run
```no-highlight
fastlane action match_nuke
```

<hr />

## CLI

It is recommended to add the above action into your `Fastfile`, however sometimes you might want to run one-offs. To do so, you can run the following command from your terminal

```no-highlight
fastlane run match_nuke
```

To pass parameters, make use of the `:` symbol, for example

```no-highlight
fastlane run match_nuke parameter1:"value1" parameter2:"value2"
```

It's important to note that the CLI supports primitive types like integers, floats, booleans, and strings. Arrays can be passed as a comma delimited string (e.g. `param:"1,2,3"`). Hashes are not currently supported.

It is recommended to add all _fastlane_ actions you use to your `Fastfile`.

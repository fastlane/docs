# last_git_tag


Get the most recent git tag




> If you are using this action on a **shallow clone**, *the default with some CI systems like Bamboo*, you need to ensure that you have also pulled all the git tags appropriately. Assuming your git repo has the correct remote set you can issue `sh('git fetch --tags')`.<br>Pattern parameter allows you to filter to a subset of tags.

## Documentation

To show the documentation in your terminal, run
```no-highlight
fastlane action last_git_tag
```

<hr />

## CLI

It is recommended to add the above action into your `Fastfile`, however sometimes you might want to run one-offs. To do so, you can run the following command from your terminal

```no-highlight
fastlane run last_git_tag
```

To pass parameters, make use of the `:` symbol, for example

```no-highlight
fastlane run last_git_tag parameter1:"value1" parameter2:"value2"
```

It's important to note that the CLI supports primitive types like integers, floats, booleans, and strings. Arrays can be passed as a comma delimited string (e.g. `param:"1,2,3"`). Hashes are not currently supported.

It is recommended to add all _fastlane_ actions you use to your `Fastfile`.

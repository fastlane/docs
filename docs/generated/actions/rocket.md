## 1 Example

```ruby
rocket
```





<hr />



## Documentation

To show the documentation in your terminal, run
```no-highlight
fastlane action rocket
```

<hr />

## CLI

It is recommended to add the above action into your `Fastfile`, however sometimes you might want to run one-offs. To do so, you can run the following command from your terminal

```no-highlight
fastlane run rocket
```

To pass parameters, make use of the `:` symbol, for example

```no-highlight
fastlane run rocket parameter1:"value1" parameter2:"value2"
```

It's important to note that the CLI supports primitive types like integers, floats, booleans, and strings. Arrays can be passed as a comma delimited string (e.g. `param:"1,2,3"`). Hashes are not currently supported.

It is recommended to add all _fastlane_ actions you use to your `Fastfile`.

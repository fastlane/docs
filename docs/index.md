_fastlane_ is **the** tool to release your iOS and Android app ðŸš€ It handles all tedious tasks, like generating screenshots, dealing with code signing, and releasing your application.

You create a so-called `Fastfile` in your repository, that defines how your beta or App Store release process:

```ruby
lane :beta do
  increment_build_number
  gym                       # Build your app
  testflight                # Upload to TestFlight
end

lane :appstore do
  snapshot                  # Generate screenshots for the App Store
  gym                       # Build your app
  deliver                   # Upload the screenshots and the binary to iTunes
  slack                     # Let your team-mates know the new version is live
end
```

You just defined 2 different lanes, one for beta deployment, one for App Store. To release your app in the App Store, all you have to do is

```no-highlight
fastlane appstore
```

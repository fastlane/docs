# Appfile

The `Appfile` stores useful information that are used across all _fastlane_ tools like your *Apple ID* or the application *Bundle Identifier*, to deploy your lanes faster and tailored on your project needs.

The `Appfile` has to be inside your `./fastlane` directory.

By default an `Appfile` looks like:

```ruby
app_identifier "net.sunapps.1" # The bundle identifier of your app
apple_id "felix@krausefx.com"  # Your Apple email address

# You can uncomment the lines below and add your own
# team selection in case you're in multiple teams
# team_name "Felix Krause"
# team_id "Q2CBPJ58CA"

# To select a team for App Store Connect use
# itc_team_name "Company Name"
# itc_team_id "18742801"
```

If you have different credentials for App Store Connect and the Apple Developer Portal use the following code:

```ruby
app_identifier "tools.fastlane.app"       # The bundle identifier of your app

apple_dev_portal_id "portal@company.com"  # Apple Developer Account
itunes_connect_id "tunes@company.com"     # App Store Connect Account

team_id "Q2CBPJ58CA" # Developer Portal Team ID
itc_team_id "18742801" # App Store Connect Team ID
```

If your project has different bundle identifiers per environment (i.e. beta, app store), you can define that by using `for_platform` and/or `for_lane` block declaration.

```ruby
app_identifier "net.sunapps.1"
apple_id "felix@krausefx.com"
team_id "Q2CBPJ58CC"

for_platform :ios do
  team_id '123' # for all iOS related things
  for_lane :test do
    app_identifier 'com.app.test'
  end
end
```

You only have to use `for_platform` if you're using `platform [platform_name] do` in your `Fastfile`.

_fastlane_ will always use the lane specific value if given, otherwise fall back to the value on the top of the file. Therefore, while driving the `:test` lane, this configuration is loaded:

```ruby
app_identifier "com.app.test"
apple_id "felix@krausefx.com"
team_id "123"
```

## Accessing from fastlane

If you want to access those values from within your `Fastfile` use

```ruby
identifier = CredentialsManager::AppfileConfig.try_fetch_value(:app_identifier)
team_id = CredentialsManager::AppfileConfig.try_fetch_value(:team_id)
```

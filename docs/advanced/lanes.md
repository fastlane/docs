# Lanes

# Passing Parameters

To pass parameters from the command line to your lane, use the following syntax:

```no-highlight
fastlane [lane] key:value key2:value2

fastlane deploy submit:false build_number:24
```

To access those values, change your lane declaration to also include `|options|`

```ruby
before_all do |lane, options|
  # ...
end

before_each do |lane, options|
  # ...
end

lane :deploy do |options|
  # ...
  if options[:submit]
    # Only when submit is true
  end
  # ...
  increment_build_number(build_number: options[:build_number])
  # ...
end

after_all do |lane, options|
  # ...
end

after_each do |lane, options|
  # ...
end

error do |lane, exception, options|
  if options[:debug]
    puts "Hi :)"
  end
end
```

# Switching lanes

To switch lanes while executing a lane, use the following code:

```ruby
lane :deploy do |options|
  # ...
  build(release: true) # that's the important bit
  hockey
  # ...
end

lane :staging do |options|
  # ...
  build # it also works when you don't pass parameters
  hockey
  # ...
end

lane :build do |options|
  scheme = (options[:release] ? "Release" : "Staging")
  build_ios_app(scheme: scheme)
end
```

_fastlane_ takes care of all the magic for you. You can call lanes of the same platform or a general lane outside of the `platform` definition.

Passing parameters is optional.

## Returning values
Additionally, you can retrieve the return value. In Ruby, the last line of the `lane` definition is the return value. Here is an example:

```ruby
lane :deploy do |options|
  value = calculate(value: 3)
  puts value # => 5
end

lane :calculate do |options|
  # ...
  2 + options[:value] # the last line will always be the return value
end
```

## Stop executing a lane early

The `next` keyword can be used to stop executing a `lane` before it reaches the end.

```ruby
lane :build do |options|
  if cached_build_available?
    UI.important 'Skipping build because a cached build is available!'
    next # skip doing the rest of this lane
  end
  match
  gym
end

private_lane :cached_build_available? do |options|
  # ...
  true
end
```

When `next` is used during a `lane` switch, control returns to the previous `lane` that was executing.

```ruby
lane :first_lane do |options|
  puts "If you run: `fastlane first_lane`"
  puts "You'll see this!"
  second_lane
  puts "As well as this!"
end

private_lane :second_lane do |options|
  next
  puts "This won't be shown"
end
```

When you stop executing a lane early with `next`, any `after_each` and `after_all` blocks you have will still trigger as usual :+1:

## `before_each` and `after_each` blocks

`before_each` blocks are called before any lane is called. This would include being called before each lane you've switched to.
```ruby
before_each do |lane, options|
  # ...
end
```

`after_each` blocks are called after any lane is called. This would include being called after each lane you've switched to.
Just like `after_all`, `after_each` is not called if an error occurs. The `error` block should be used in this case.
```ruby
after_each do |lane, options|
  # ...
end
```

e.g. With this scenario, `before_each` and `after_each` would be called 4 times: before the `deploy` lane, before the switch to `archive`, `sign`, and `upload`, and after each of these lanes as well.

```ruby
lane :deploy do
  archive
  sign
  upload
end

lane :archive do
  # ...
end

lane :sign do
  # ...
end

lane :upload do
  # ...
end
```

# Lane Properties

It can be useful to dynamically access properties of the current lane. These are available in `lane_context`:

```ruby
lane_context[SharedValues::PLATFORM_NAME]        # Platform name, e.g. `:ios`, `:android` or empty (for root level lanes)
lane_context[SharedValues::LANE_NAME]            # The name of the current lane preceded by the platform name (stays the same when switching lanes)
lane_context[SharedValues::DEFAULT_PLATFORM]     # Default platform
```

and environment variables:

```ruby
ENV["FASTLANE_PLATFORM_NAME"]
ENV["FASTLANE_LANE_NAME"]
```

# Lane Context

The different actions can *communicate* with each other using a shared hash. You can access this in your lanes with the following code:

```ruby
lane_context[SharedValues::VARIABLE_NAME_HERE]
```

Here are some examples:

```ruby
lane_context[SharedValues::BUILD_NUMBER]                # Generated by `increment_build_number`
lane_context[SharedValues::VERSION_NUMBER]              # Generated by `increment_version_number`
lane_context[SharedValues::SNAPSHOT_SCREENSHOTS_PATH]   # Generated by _snapshot_
lane_context[SharedValues::PRODUCE_APPLE_ID]            # The Apple ID of the newly created app
lane_context[SharedValues::IPA_OUTPUT_PATH]             # Generated by _gym_
lane_context[SharedValues::DSYM_OUTPUT_PATH]            # Generated by _gym_
lane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_PROFILE_PATH]           # Generated by _sigh_
lane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_UDID]                   # The UDID of the generated provisioning profile
lane_context[SharedValues::HOCKEY_DOWNLOAD_LINK]        # Generated by `hockey`
lane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_APK_OUTPUT_PATH]      # Generated by `gradle`
lane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_ALL_APK_OUTPUT_PATHS] # Generated by `gradle`
lane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_FLAVOR]               # Generated by `gradle`
lane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_BUILD_TYPE]           # Generated by `gradle`
```

To get information about available lane variables, run `fastlane action [action_name]`.

# Private lanes

Sometimes you might have a lane that is used from different lanes, for example:

```ruby
lane :production do
  # ...
  build(release: true)
  appstore # Deploy to the AppStore
  # ...
end

lane :beta do
  # ...
  build(release: false)
  crashlytics # Distribute to testers
  # ...
end

lane :build do |options|
  # ...
  ipa
  # ...
end
```

It probably doesn't make sense to execute the `build` lane directly using `fastlane build`. You can hide this lane using

```ruby
private_lane :build do |options|
  # ...
end
```

This will hide the lane from:

- `fastlane lanes`
- `fastlane list`
- `fastlane docs`

And also, you can't call the private lane using `fastlane build`.

The resulting private lane can only be called from another lane using the lane switching technology.

# Control configuration by lane and by platform

In general, configuration files take only the first value given for a particular configuration item. That means that for an `Appfile` like the following:

```ruby
app_identifier "com.used.id"
app_identifier "com.ignored.id"
```

the `app_identfier` will be `"com.used.id"` and the second value will be ignored. The `for_lane` and `for_platform` configuration blocks provide a limited exception to this rule.

All configuration files (Appfile, Matchfile, Screengrabfile, etc.) can use `for_lane` and `for_platform` blocks to control (and override) configuration values for those circumstances.

`for_lane` blocks will be called when the name of lane invoked on the command line matches the one specified by the block. So, given a `Screengrabfile` like:

```ruby
locales ['en-US', 'fr-FR', 'ja-JP']

for_lane :screenshots_english_only do
  locales ['en-US']
end

for_lane :screenshots_french_only do
  locales ['fr-FR']
end
```

`locales` will have the values `['en-US', 'fr-FR', 'ja-JP']` by default, but will only have one value when running the `fastlane screenshots_english_only` or `fastlane screenshots_french_only`.

`for_platform` gives you similar control based on the platform for which you have invoked _fastlane_. So, for an `Appfile` configured like:

```ruby
app_identifier "com.default.id"

for_lane :enterprise do
  app_identifier "com.forlane.enterprise"
end

for_platform :mac do
  app_identifier "com.forplatform.mac"

  for_lane :release do
    app_identifier "com.forplatform.mac.forlane.release"
  end
end
```

you can expect the `app_identifier` to equal `"com.forplatform.mac.forlane.release"` when invoking `fastlane mac release`.

You can use [`fastlane run validate_play_store_json_key json_key:/path/to/your/downloaded/file.json`](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/validate_play_store_json_key/) to test the connection to Google Play Store with the downloaded private key. Once that works, add the path to the JSON file to your [Appfile](/advanced/Appfile):

```ruby
json_key_file("path/to/your/play-store-credentials.json")
package_name("my.package.name")
```
The path is relative to where you normally run `fastlane`.

**Tip:** If you see Google Play Console or Google Developer Console in your local language, add `&hl=en` at the end of the URL (before any `#...`) to switch to English.

1. Open the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/)
1. Click **Setup** â†’ **API access**
2. Note the name of the **Linked project** under the **Google Cloud Project** heading
3. Click the **Create new service account** button
4. Follow the **Google Cloud Platform** link in the dialog, which opens a new tab/window:
   1. Click the **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT** button at the top of the **Google Cloud Platform Console**
   1. Verify that you are on the correct Google Cloud Platform Project by looking for the name of the **Linked project** from earlier in the top left portion of the header, just right of the **Google Cloud** title. If not, open the picker in the top navigation bar, and it from the dropdown.
   1. Provide a `Service account name` and click **Create**
   1. Click **Select a role**, then find and select **Service Account User**, and proceed
   1. Click the **Done** button
   1. Click on the **Actions** vertical three-dot icon of the service account you just created
   1. Select **Manage keys** on the menu
   1. Click **ADD KEY** -> **Create New Key**
   1. Make sure **JSON** is selected as the `Key type`, and click **CREATE**
   1. Save the file on your computer when prompted and remember where it was saved to
5. Return to the **Google Play Console** tab, and click **DONE** to close the dialog
6. Click on **Grant Access** for the newly added service account at the bottom of the screen (you may need to click **Refresh service accounts** before it shows up)
7. Choose the permissions you'd like this account to have. We recommend **Admin (all permissions)**, but you may want to manually select all checkboxes and leave out some of the **Releases** permissions such as **Release to production**
8. Click **Invite user** to finish

You can use [`fastlane run validate_play_store_json_key json_key:/path/to/your/downloaded/file.json`](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/validate_play_store_json_key/) to test the connection to Google Play Store with the downloaded private key. Once that works, add the path to the JSON file to your [Appfile](/advanced/Appfile):

```ruby
json_key_file("path/to/your/play-store-credentials.json")
package_name("my.package.name")
```
The path is relative to where you normally run `fastlane`.

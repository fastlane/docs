# last_git_tag


Get the most recent git tag




> If you are using this action on a **shallow clone**, *the default with some CI systems like Bamboo*, you need to ensure that you have also pulled all the git tags appropriately. Assuming your git repo has the correct remote set you can issue `sh('git fetch --tags')`.

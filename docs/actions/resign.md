# resign


Codesign an existing ipa file







resign ||
---|---
Supported platforms | ios
Author | @lmirosevic



## 2 Examples

```ruby
resign(
  ipa: "path/to/ipa", # can omit if using the `ipa` action
  signing_identity: "iPhone Distribution: Luka Mirosevic (0123456789)",
  provisioning_profile: "path/to/profile", # can omit if using the _sigh_ action
)
```

```ruby
# You may provide multiple provisioning profiles if the application contains nested
# applications or app extensions, which need their own provisioning profile.
# You can do so by passing an array of provisioning profile strings or a hash
# that associates provisioning profile values to bundle identifier keys.
resign(
  ipa: "path/to/ipa", # can omit if using the `ipa` action
  signing_identity: "iPhone Distribution: Luka Mirosevic (0123456789)",
  provisioning_profile: {
    "com.example.awesome-app" => "path/to/profile",
    "com.example.awesome-app.app-extension" => "path/to/app-extension/profile"
  }
)
```

## Documentation

To show the documentation in your terminal, run
```no-highlight
fastlane action resign
```

<hr />

## CLI

It is recommended to add the above action into your `Fastfile`, however sometimes you might want to run one-offs. To do so, you can run the following command from your terminal

```no-highlight
fastlane run resign
```

To pass parameters, make use of the `:` symbol, for example

```no-highlight
fastlane run resign parameter1:"value1" parameter2:"value2"
```

It's important to note that the CLI supports primitive types like integers, floats, booleans, and strings. Arrays can be passed as a comma delimited string (e.g. `param:"1,2,3"`). Hashes are not currently supported.

It is recommended to add all _fastlane_ actions you use to your `Fastfile`.

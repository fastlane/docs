# get_push_certificate


Ensure a valid push profile is active, creating a new one if needed (via _pem_)




> Additionally to the available options, you can also specify a block that only gets executed if a new
profile was created. You can use it to upload the new profile to your server.
Use it like this: 
get_push_certificate(
  new_profile: proc do 
    # your upload code
  end
)

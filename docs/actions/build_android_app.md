# build_android_app


Alias for the `gradle` action




> Run `./gradlew tasks` to get a list of all available gradle tasks for your project


build_android_app |
-----|----
Supported platforms | ios, android
Author | @KrauseFx, @lmirosevic
Returns | The output of running the gradle task



## 3 Examples

```ruby
gradle(
  task: "assemble",
  flavor: "WorldDomination",
  build_type: "Release"
)
```

```ruby
gradle(
  # ...

  properties: {
    "versionCode" => 100,
    "versionName" => "1.0.0",
    # ...
  }
)
```

You can use this to automatically [sign and zipalign](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html) your app:
```ruby
gradle(
  task: "assemble",
  build_type: "Release",
  print_command: false,
  properties: {
    "android.injected.signing.store.file" => "keystore.jks",
    "android.injected.signing.store.password" => "store_password",
    "android.injected.signing.key.alias" => "key_alias",
    "android.injected.signing.key.password" => "key_password",
  }
)
```

```ruby
# If you need to pass sensitive information through the `gradle` action, and don't want the generated command to be printed before it is run, you can suppress that:
gradle(
  # ...
  print_command: false
)
```

You can also suppress printing the output generated by running the generated Gradle command:
```ruby
gradle(
  # ...
  print_command_output: false
)
```

To pass any other CLI flags to gradle use:
```ruby
gradle(
  # ...

  flags: "--exitcode --xml file.xml"
)
```





## Parameters

Key | Description
----|------------
  `task` | The gradle task you want to execute, e.g. `assemble` or `test`. For tasks such as `assembleMyFlavorRelease` you should use gradle(task: 'assemble', flavor: 'Myflavor', build_type: 'Release')
  `flavor` | The flavor that you want the task for, e.g. `MyFlavor`. If you are running the `assemble` task in a multi-flavor project, and you rely on Actions.lane_context[Actions.SharedValues::GRADLE_APK_OUTPUT_PATH] then you must specify a flavor here or else this value will be undefined
  `build_type` | The build type that you want the task for, e.g. `Release`. Useful for some tasks such as `assemble`
  `flags` | All parameter flags you want to pass to the gradle command, e.g. `--exitcode --xml file.xml`
  `project_dir` | The root directory of the gradle project. Defaults to `.`
  `gradle_path` | The path to your `gradlew`. If you specify a relative path, it is assumed to be relative to the `project_dir`
  `properties` | Gradle properties to be exposed to the gradle script
  `system_properties` | Gradle system properties to be exposed to the gradle script
  `serial` | Android serial, which device should be used for this command
  `print_command` | Control whether the generated Gradle command is printed as output before running it (true/false)
  `print_command_output` | Control whether the output produced by given Gradle command is printed while running (true/false)

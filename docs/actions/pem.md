###### Automatically generate and renew your push notification profiles

Tired of manually creating and maintaining your push notification profiles for your iOS apps? Tired of generating a _pem_ file for your server?

_pem_ does all that for you, just by simply running _pem_.

_pem_ creates new .pem, .cer, and .p12 files to be uploaded to your push server if a valid push notification profile is needed. _pem_ does not cover uploading the file to your server.

To automate iOS Provisioning profiles you can use [_match_](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/).

# Features
Well, it's actually just one: Generate the ``_pem_`` file for your server.

Check out this gif:

# Usage

    fastlane pem

Yes, that's the whole command!

This does the following:

- Create a new signing request
- Create a new push certification
- Downloads the certificate
- Generates a new ```.pem``` file in the current working directory, which you can upload to your server

Note that ``_pem_`` will never revoke your existing certificates. _pem_ can't download any of your existing push certificates, as the private key is only available on the machine it was created on. 

If you already have a push certificate enabled, which is active for at least 30 more days, _pem_ will not create a new certificate. If you still want to create one, use the `force`:

    fastlane pem --force

You can pass parameters like this:

    fastlane pem -a com.krausefx.app -u username

If you want to generate a development certificate instead:

    fastlane pem --development

Set a password for your `p12` file:

    fastlane pem -p "MyPass"

You can specify a name for the output file:

    fastlane pem -o my.pem

To get a list of available options run:

    fastlane action pem


### Note about empty `p12` passwords and Keychain Access.app

_pem_ will produce a valid `p12` without specifying a password, or using the empty-string as the password.
While the file is valid, the Mac's Keychain Access will not allow you to open the file without specifying a passphrase.

Instead, you may verify the file is valid using OpenSSL:

    openssl pkcs12 -info -in my.p12

If you need the `p12` in your keychain, perhaps to test push with an app like [Knuff](https://github.com/KnuffApp/Knuff) or [Pusher](https://github.com/noodlewerk/NWPusher), you can use `openssl` to export the `p12` to _pem_ and back to `p12`:

    % openssl pkcs12 -in my.p12 -out my.pem
    Enter Import Password:
      <hit enter: the p12 has no password>
    MAC verified OK
    Enter PEM pass phrase:
      <enter a temporary password to encrypt the pem file>
      
    % openssl pkcs12 -export -in my.pem -out my-with-passphrase.p12
    Enter pass phrase for temp.pem:
      <enter the temporary password to decrypt the pem file>

    Enter Export Password:
      <enter a password for encrypting the new p12 file>

## Environment Variables

Run `fastlane action pem` to get a list of available environment variables.

# How does it work?

_pem_ uses [_spaceship_](https://spaceship.airforce) to communicate with the Apple Developer Portal to request a new push certificate for you.

## How is my password stored?
``_pem_`` uses the [password manager](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/credentials_manager) from _fastlane_. Take a look the [CredentialsManager README](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/credentials_manager) for more information.

# Tips

## Use the 'Provisioning Quicklook plugin'
Download and install the [Provisioning Plugin](https://github.com/chockenberry/Provisioning).

It will show you the ``_pem_`` files like this:

# get_provisioning_profile


Generates a provisioning profile, saving it in the current folder (via _sigh_)




> **Note**: It is recommended to use [match](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/match) according to the [codesigning.guide](https://codesigning.guide) for generating and maintaining your provisioning profiles. Use _sigh_ directly only if you want full control over what's going on and know more about codesigning.

<h5 align="center"><em>cert</em> is part of <a href="https://fastlane.tools">fastlane</a>: The easiest way to automate beta deployments and releases for your iOS and Android apps.</h5>

In the gif we used `cert && sigh`, which will first create an iOS code signing certificate and then a provisioning profile for your app if _cert_ succeeded.

# Usage

**Note**: It is recommended to use [_match_](/actions/match/) according to the [codesigning.guide](https://codesigning.guide) for generating and maintaining your certificates. Use _cert_ directly only if you want full control over what's going on and know more about codesigning.

```no-highlight
fastlane cert
```

This will check if any of the available signing certificates is installed on your local machine.

Only if a new certificate needs to be created, _cert_ will

- Create a new private key
- Create a new signing request
- Generate, downloads and installs the certificate
- Import all the generated files into your Keychain

_cert_ will never revoke your existing certificates. If you can't create any more certificates, _cert_ will raise an exception, which means, you have to revoke one of the existing certificates to make room for a new one.


You can pass your Apple ID:

```no-highlight
fastlane cert -u cert@krausefx.com
```

For a list of available commands run

```no-highlight
fastlane action cert
```

Keep in mind, there is no way for _cert_ to download existing certificates + private keys from the Apple Developer Portal, as the private key never leaves your computer.

## Environment Variables

Run `fastlane action cert` to get a list of all available environment variables.

## Use with [_sigh_](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/sigh/)

_cert_ becomes really interesting when used in [_fastlane_](https://fastlane.tools) in combination with [_sigh_](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/sigh/).

Update your `Fastfile` to contain the following code:

```ruby
lane :beta do
  cert
  sigh(force: true)
end
```

`force: true` will make sure to re-generate the provisioning profile on each run.
This will result in _sigh_ always using the correct signing certificate, which is installed on the local machine.


## How is my password stored?
_cert_ uses the [password manager](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/credentials_manager) from _fastlane_. Take a look the [CredentialsManager README](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/credentials_manager/README.md) for more information.

# Tips

## Use 'ProvisionQL' for advanced Quick Look in Finder

Install [ProvisionQL](https://github.com/ealeksandrov/ProvisionQL).

It will show you `mobileprovision` files like this:

## 3 Examples

```ruby
get_certificates
```

```ruby
cert # alias for "get_certificates"
```

```ruby
get_certificates(
  development: true,
  username: "user@email.com"
)
```





## Parameters

Key | Description | Default
----|-------------|--------
  `development` | Create a development certificate instead of a distribution one | `false`
  `force` | Create a certificate even if an existing certificate exists | `false`
  `generate_apple_certs` | Create a certificate type for Xcode 11 and later (Apple Development or Apple Distribution) | [*](#parameters-legend-dynamic)
  `username` | Your Apple ID Username | [*](#parameters-legend-dynamic)
  `team_id` | The ID of your Developer Portal team if you're in multiple teams | [*](#parameters-legend-dynamic)
  `team_name` | The name of your Developer Portal team if you're in multiple teams | [*](#parameters-legend-dynamic)
  `filename` | The filename of certificate to store | 
  `output_path` | The path to a directory in which all certificates and private keys should be stored | `.`
  `keychain_path` | Path to a custom keychain | [*](#parameters-legend-dynamic)
  `keychain_password` | This might be required the first time you access certificates on a new mac. For the login/default keychain this is your account password | 
  `platform` | Set the provisioning profile's platform (ios, macos) | `ios`

<em id="parameters-legend-dynamic">* = default value is dependent on the user's system</em>

## Lane Variables

Actions can communicate with each other using a shared hash `lane_context`, that can be accessed in other actions, plugins or your lanes: `lane_context[SharedValues:XYZ]`. The `cert` action generates the following Lane Variables:

SharedValue | Description 
------------|-------------
  `SharedValues::CERT_FILE_PATH` | The path to the certificate
  `SharedValues::CERT_CERTIFICATE_ID` | The id of the certificate

To get more information check the [Lanes documentation](https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/lanes/#lane-context).
<hr />


## Documentation

To show the documentation in your terminal, run
```no-highlight
fastlane action cert
```

<hr />

## CLI

It is recommended to add the above action into your `Fastfile`, however sometimes you might want to run one-offs. To do so, you can run the following command from your terminal

```no-highlight
fastlane run cert
```

To pass parameters, make use of the `:` symbol, for example

```no-highlight
fastlane run cert parameter1:"value1" parameter2:"value2"
```

It's important to note that the CLI supports primitive types like integers, floats, booleans, and strings. Arrays can be passed as a comma delimited string (e.g. `param:"1,2,3"`). Hashes are not currently supported.

It is recommended to add all _fastlane_ actions you use to your `Fastfile`.

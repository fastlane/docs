# s3


Generates a plist file and uploads all to AWS S3

> Please use the `aws_s3` plugin instead.<br>Install using `fastlane add_plugin aws_s3`.


> Upload a new build to Amazon S3 to distribute the build to beta testers.<br>Works for both Ad Hoc and Enterprise signed applications. This step will generate the necessary HTML, plist, and version files for you.<br>It is recommended to **not** store the AWS access keys in the `Fastfile`. The uploaded `version.json` file provides an easy way for apps to poll if a new update is available.

## Lane Variables

Actions can communicate with each other using a shared hash `lane_context`, that can be accessed in other actions, plugins or your lanes: `lane_context[SharedValues:XYZ]`. The `s3` action generates the following Lane Variables:

SharedValue | Description 
------------|-------------
  `SharedValues::S3_IPA_OUTPUT_PATH` | Direct HTTP link to the uploaded ipa file
  `SharedValues::S3_DSYM_OUTPUT_PATH` | Direct HTTP link to the uploaded dsym file
  `SharedValues::S3_PLIST_OUTPUT_PATH` | Direct HTTP link to the uploaded plist file
  `SharedValues::S3_HTML_OUTPUT_PATH` | Direct HTTP link to the uploaded HTML file
  `SharedValues::S3_VERSION_OUTPUT_PATH` | Direct HTTP link to the uploaded Version file

To get more information check the [Lanes documentation](https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/lanes/#lane-context).
<hr />


## Documentation

To show the documentation in your terminal, run
```no-highlight
fastlane action s3
```

<hr />

## CLI

It is recommended to add the above action into your `Fastfile`, however sometimes you might want to run one-offs. To do so, you can run the following command from your terminal

```no-highlight
fastlane run s3
```

To pass parameters, make use of the `:` symbol, for example

```no-highlight
fastlane run s3 parameter1:"value1" parameter2:"value2"
```

It's important to note that the CLI supports primitive types like integers, floats, booleans, and strings. Arrays can be passed as a comma delimited string (e.g. `param:"1,2,3"`). Hashes are not currently supported.

It is recommended to add all _fastlane_ actions you use to your `Fastfile`.

<hr />

## Source code

This action, just like the rest of _fastlane_, is fully open source, <a href="https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/lib/fastlane/actions/s3.rb" target="_blank">view the source code on GitHub</a>

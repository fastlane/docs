# xcodebuild


Use the `xcodebuild` command to build and sign your app




> **Note**: `xcodebuild` is a complex command, so it is recommended to use [_gym_](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/gym/) for building your ipa file and [_scan_](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/scan/) for testing your app instead.

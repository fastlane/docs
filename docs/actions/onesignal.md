## Lane Variables

Actions can communicate with each other using a shared hash `lane_context`, that can be accessed in other actions, plugins or your lanes: `lane_context[SharedValues:XYZ]`. The `onesignal` action generates the following Lane Variables:

SharedValue | Description 
------------|-------------
  `SharedValues::ONE_SIGNAL_APP_ID` | The app ID of the newly created or updated app
  `SharedValues::ONE_SIGNAL_APP_AUTH_KEY` | The auth token for the newly created or updated app

To get more information check the [Lanes documentation](https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/lanes/#lane-context).

## Documentation

To show the documentation in your terminal, run
```no-highlight
fastlane action onesignal
```

<hr />

## CLI

It is recommended to add the above action into your `Fastfile`, however sometimes you might want to run one-offs. To do so, you can run the following command from your terminal

```no-highlight
fastlane run onesignal
```

To pass parameters, make use of the `:` symbol, for example

```no-highlight
fastlane run onesignal parameter1:"value1" parameter2:"value2"
```

It's important to note that the CLI supports primitive types like integers, floats, booleans, and strings. Arrays can be passed as a comma delimited string (e.g. `param:"1,2,3"`). Hashes are not currently supported.

It is recommended to add all _fastlane_ actions you use to your `Fastfile`.

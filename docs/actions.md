# fastlane actions

This page contains a list of all built-in fastlane actions and their available options.

To get the most up-to-date information from the command line on your current version you can also run

```sh
fastlane actions # list all available fastlane actions
fastlane action [action_name] # more information for a specific action
```

You can import another `Fastfile` by using the `import` action. This is useful if you have shared lanes across multiple apps and you want to store a `Fastfile` in a separate folder. The path must be relative to the `Fastfile` this is called from.

```ruby
import './path/to/other/Fastfile'
```

### register_devices

Registers new devices to the Apple Dev Portal

> This will register iOS devices with the Developer Portal so that you can include them in your provisioning profiles.
This is an optimistic action, in that it will only ever add new devices to the member center, and never remove devices. If a device which has already been registered within the member center is not passed to this action, it will be left alone in the member center and continue to work.
The action will connect to the Apple Developer Portal using the username you specified in your `Appfile` with `apple_id`, but you can override it using the `username` option, or by setting the env variable `ENV['DELIVER_USER']`.

### ensure_git_status_clean

Raises an exception if there are uncommited git changes

> A sanity check to make sure you are working in a repo that is clean. Especially
useful to put at the beginning of your Fastfile in the `before_all` block, if
some of your other actions will touch your filesystem, do things to your git repo,
or just as a general reminder to save your work. Also needed as a prerequisite for
some other actions like `reset_git_repo`.

</details>






### reset_git_repo

Resets git repo to a clean state by discarding uncommited changes

> This action will reset your git repo to a clean state, discarding any uncommitted and untracked changes. Useful in case you need to revert the repo back to a clean state, e.g. after the fastlane run. Untracked files like `.env` will also be deleted, unless `:skip_clean` is true. It's a pretty drastic action so it comes with a sort of safety latch. It will only proceed with the reset if either of these conditions are met: You have called the ensure_git_status_clean action prior to calling this action. This ensures that your repo started off in a clean state, so the only things that will get destroyed by this action are files that are created as a byproduct of the fastlane run.

-----|----
Supported platforms | ios, android, mac
Author | @lmirosevic



<details>
<summary>4 Examples</summary>

```ruby
reset_git_repo
```

```ruby
reset_git_repo(force: true) # If you don't care about warnings and are absolutely sure that you want to discard all changes. This will reset the repo even if you have valuable uncommitted changes, so use with care!
```

```ruby
reset_git_repo(skip_clean: true) # If you want "git clean" to be skipped, thus NOT deleting untracked files like ".env". Optional, defaults to false.
```

```ruby
reset_git_repo(
  force: true,
  files: [
    "./file.txt"
  ]
)
```


</details>


<details>
<summary>Parameters</summary>

Key | Description
----|------------
  `files` | Array of files the changes should be discarded. If not given, all files will be discarded
  `force` | Skip verifying of previously clean state of repo. Only recommended in combination with `files` option
  `skip_clean` | Skip 'git clean' to avoid removing untracked files like `.env`. Defaults to false
  `disregard_gitignore` | Setting this to true will clean the whole repository, ignoring anything in your local .gitignore. Set this to true if you want the equivalent of a fresh clone, and for all untracked and ignore files to also be removed
  `exclude` | You can pass a string, or array of, file pattern(s) here which you want to have survive the cleaning process, and remain on disk. E.g. to leave the `artifacts` directory you would specify `exclude: 'artifacts'`. Make sure this pattern is also in your gitignore! See the gitignore documentation for info on patterns

### commit_version_bump

Creates a 'Version Bump' commit. Run after `increment_build_number`

> This action will create a 'Version Bump' commit in your repo. Useful in conjunction with `increment_build_number`.
It checks the repo to make sure that only the relevant files have changed, these are the files that `increment_build_number` (`agvtool`) touches:
- All .plist files
- The `.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file
Then commits those files to the repo.
Customise the message with the `:message` option, defaults to 'Version Bump'
If you have other uncommitted changes in your repo, this action will fail. If you started off in a clean repo, and used the _ipa_ and or _sigh_ actions, then you can use the `clean_build_artifacts` action to clean those temporary files up before running this action.

### update_fastlane

Makes sure fastlane-tools are up-to-date when running fastlane

> This action will look at all installed fastlane tools and update them to the next available minor version - major version updates will not be performed automatically, as they might include breaking changes. If an update was performed, fastlane will be restarted before the run continues.
If you are using rbenv or rvm, everything should be good to go. However, if you are using the system's default ruby, some additional setup is needed for this action to work correctly. In short, fastlane needs to be able to access your gem library without running in `sudo` mode.
The simplest possible fix for this is putting the following lines into your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:
```bash
export GEM_HOME=~/.gems
export PATH=$PATH:~/.gems/bin
```
After the above changes, restart your terminal, then run `mkdir $GEM_HOME` to create the new gem directory. After this, you're good to go!
Recommended usage of the `update_fastlane` action is at the top of the `before_all` block, before running any other action

Loads a CocoaPods spec as JSON

Loads the specified (or the first found) podspec in the folder as JSON, so that you can inspect its `version`, `files` etc. 
This can be useful when basing your release process on the version string only stored in one place - in the podspec. As one of 
the first steps you'd read the podspec and its version and the rest of the workflow can use that version string (when e.g. creating a new git tag or a GitHub Release).

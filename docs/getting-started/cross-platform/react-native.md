# Getting started with _fastlane_ for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

Most of the _fastlane_ docs on this page apply to React Native projects as well. 

As there is no official getting started guide yet, here are some publications by the _fastlane_ community:

- [Shipping React Native apps with fastlane](https://carloscuesta.me/blog/shipping-react-native-apps-with-fastlane/)
- [Conference talk "Automate your React Native world with fastlane"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K5OLv3moFg)

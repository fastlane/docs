# _fastlane_ screenshots for iOS and tvOS

Your App Store screenshots are probably the most important thing when it comes to convincing potential users to download or purchase your app. Unfortunately, many apps don't do screenshots well. This is often because taking screenshots of your app and then preparing them for display is time consuming, and it's hard to get everything right and consistent! For example:

- Are the screenshots in the App Store inconsistent with your latest app design?
- Is your app localized into many languages that require different screenshots for each?
- Have you made sure that no loading indicators are showing?
- Is the same content displayed for each of your size variations?

_fastlane_ tools can automate this process making it fast, and consistent while giving you beautiful results!

## Alternatives

For the full story about the many ways that developers can capture and beautify screenshots check out [this article](https://krausefx.com/blog/creating-perfect-app-store-screenshots-of-your-ios-app).

### Manually Capturing Screenshots

Manually taking screenshots takes too much time, which also decreases the quality of the screenshots. Since it is not automated, the screenshots will show slightly different content on the various devices and languages. Many companies choose to create screenshots in one language and use them for all languages. While this might seem okay to us developers, there are many potential users out there that cannot read the text on your app screenshots if they are not localised. Have you ever looked at a screenshots with content in a language you don't know? It won't convince you to download the app.

However, the biggest disadvantage of this method is what happens when you need to repeat the process. If you notice a spelling mistake in the screenshots, if you release an update with a new design, or if you just want to show more up to date content, you'll have to create new screenshots for all languages and devices... manually.

The positive side of this approach is that your screenshots will all be crisp and correctly sized, with readable text.

### Scaled Screenshots via iTunes Connect

With the [iTunes Connect screenshot update](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=08082016a) from August 2016, you can now use one set of screenshots for all available devices and screenshots. iTunes Connect will automatically scale the images for you, so that each device renders the same image.

While this is convenient, this approach has the same problems as the device frame approach: The screenshots don't actually show how the app looks on the user's device. It's a valid way to start though, since you can gradually overwrite screenshots for specific languages and devices.

# Capture Screenshots Automatically

_snapshot_ works with _fastlane_ to automate the process of capturing screenshots of your app. It allows you to:

- Capture hundreds of screenshots in multiple languages on all simulators
- Take screenshots in multiple device simulators concurrently to cut down execution time (Xcode 9 only)
- Do something else while the computer takes the screenshots for you
- Configure it once, and store the configuration so anyone on the team can run it
- Generate a beautiful web page showing all screenshots on all devices. This is perfect to send to Q&A, marketing, or translators for verification
- Avoid having loading indicators in your App Store screenshots by intelligently waiting for network requests to be finished
- Get a summary of how your app looks like across all supported devices and languages

After _snapshot_ successfully captures all the screenshots, it will show you a beautiful HTML page to summarize all the screens that were captured:

<a href="/img/getting-started/ios/htmlPagePreviewFade.jpg">
  <img src="/img/getting-started/ios/htmlPagePreviewFade.jpg" alt="HTML summary page" width="500" />
</a>

## Getting Started Using UI Tests

_snapshot_ uses the capabilities of Apple's UI Tests to drive interactions with your app. To get familiar with writing UI Tests, check out the following introductions:

- [WWDC 2015 Introduction to UI Tests](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-406/)
- [A first look into UI Tests](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/xcode-7-ui-testing/)
- [UI Testing in Xcode 7](http://masilotti.com/ui-testing-xcode-7/)
- [HSTestingBackchannel : ‘Cheat’ by communicating directly with your app](https://github.com/ConfusedVorlon/HSTestingBackchannel)
- [Automating App Store screenshots using fastlane snapshot and frameit](https://tisunov.github.io/2015/11/06/automating-app-store-screenshots-generation-with-fastlane-snapshot-and-sketch.html)

To jump-start your UI tests, you can use the UI Test recorder, which you can start by clicking the red record button on the bottom of the window. By interacting with your app through the simulator while using it, Xcode will generate UI Test code for you. To learn more, check out this [this blog post](https://krausefx.com/blog/run-xcode-7-ui-tests-from-the-command-line)!

## Setting Up _snapshot_

1. Create a new UI Test target in your Xcode project (See the top part of [this article](https://krausefx.com/blog/run-xcode-7-ui-tests-from-the-command-line))
1. Run `fastlane snapshot init` in your project folder
1. Add the `./SnapshotHelper.swift` file to your UI Test target (You can move the file anywhere you want)
1. Add a new Xcode scheme for the newly created UI Test target
1. Enable the `Shared` box of the newly created scheme
1. (Objective C only) Add the bridging header to your test class.
    - `#import "MYUITests-Swift.h"`
    - The bridging header is named after your test target with -Swift.h appended.
1. In your UI Test class, click the `Record` button on the bottom left and record your interaction
1. To take a screenshot, call the following between interactions
    - Swift: `snapshot("01LoginScreen")`
    - Objective C: `[Snapshot snapshot:@"01LoginScreen" waitForLoadingIndicator:YES];`
1. Add the following code to your `setUp()` method:

**Swift**

```swift
let app = XCUIApplication()
setupSnapshot(app)
app.launch()
```

**Objective C**

```objective-c
XCUIApplication *app = [[XCUIApplication alloc] init];
[Snapshot setupSnapshot:app];
[app launch];
```


The setup process will also generate a `Snapfile`, looking similar to

```ruby
# A list of devices you want to take the screenshots from
# devices([
#   "iPhone 6",
#   "iPhone 6 Plus",
#   "iPhone 5",
#   "iPhone 4s",
#   "iPad Retina",
#   "iPad Pro"
# ])

languages([
  "en-US",
  "de-DE"
])

# The name of the scheme which contains the UI Tests
# scheme "SchemeName"

# Where should the resulting screenshots be stored?
# output_directory "./screenshots"

# clear_previous_screenshots true # remove the '#' to clear all previously generated screenshots before creating new ones

# Choose which project/workspace to use
# project "./Project.xcodeproj"
# workspace "./Project.xcworkspace"

# For more information about all available options run
# fastlane action snapshot
```

You can adapt this file to fit your project. Every time you run `fastlane snapshot` the file will be loaded automatically.

For a list of all available parameters that can be used in the `Snapfile` run `fastlane action snapshot`.

If you have _fastlane_ installed, it's easy to give _snapshot_ a try. First clone the _fastlane_ repo, head over to the _snapshot_ example project, and then run `fastlane snapshot`

```no-highlight
git clone https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane  # Clone the fastlane repo
cd fastlane/snapshot/example                    # Navigate to the example project
fastlane snapshot                               # Generate screenshots for the sample app
```

# Upload Screenshots to the App Store

After generating your screenshots using `fastlane snapshot`, you usually want to upload them to iTunes Connect.

If you followed the setup guide, you already ran `fastlane init` before, so you should have your existing screenshots and metadata inside the `fastlane/screenshots` and `fastlane/metadata` directory. Running `fastlane snapshot` will store the screenshots in the `fastlane/screenshots` directory by default. 

To upload the screenshots stored in `fastlane/screenshots`, just run

```no-highlight
fastlane deliver
```

This will also show you a metadata summary, before actually uploading the screenshots, as this will overwrite the metadata and screenshots you already have on iTunes Connect. 

# Use in Fastfile

To put all of this together so that anyone on your team could trigger generating and uploading new screenshots, you can define a _fastlane_ lane called `screenshots`. It would be responsible for:

1. Running your app through _snapshot_ to automatically capture your screenshots
1. Having _deliver_ send your final screenshots to iTunes Connect for use in the App Store

Add the following code to your `fastlane/Fastfile`:

```ruby
lane :screenshots do
  capture_screenshots
  upload_to_app_store
end
```

To get a list of all available options for each of the steps, run

```no-highlight
fastlane action capture_screenshots
fastlane action upload_to_app_store
```

# Put Your Screenshots Into Device Frames

_frameit_ helps you beautify your screenshots with devices frames and text by running one simple command. It provides support for:

- Multiple device types
- Portrait and landscape orientations
- Black and silver devices
- Setting a background color and decorating the image with text

<a href="/img/getting-started/ios/frameit-results.png">
  <img src="/img/getting-started/ios/frameit-results.png" alt="frameit results" width="800" />
</a>

## Usage

Automatically add device frames around all screenshots in the current directory and its subdirectories, just run

```no-highlight
fastlane frameit
```

This will only add a device frame around the screenshots, not the background and title. Those images can be used for your website, email newsletter and similar.

If you want to implement the custom titles and background, you'll have to setup a `Framefile.json`, more information can be found [here](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/frameit#titles-and-background-optional).

If you want to upload the screenshots to the App Store, you **have** to provide a `Framefile.json`, with titles and background, otherwise the resolution of the framed screenshots doesn't match the requirements of iTunes Connect.

## Dependencies

<details>
<summary>Installing ImageMagick</summary>

_frameit_ depends on a tool called `imagemagick` to do image manipulation. The easiest way to install it is through [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```no-highlight
brew install libpng jpeg imagemagick
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting ImageMagick</summary>

If you have installed _imagemagick_ but are seeing error messages like:

```no-highlight
mogrify: no decode delegate for this image format `PNG'
```

You may need to reinstall and build from source. Run:

```no-highlight
brew uninstall imagemagick; brew install libpng jpeg; brew install imagemagick --build-from-source
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Setting Up Device Frames</summary>

To download the latest device frames, you can run

```no-highlight
fastlane frameit setup
```

This usually happens automatically when you use _frameit_ for the first time on a new machine

</details>

To add the framing to your deployment process, use the following code in your `Fastfile`:

```ruby
lane :screenshots do
  capture_screenshots
  frame_screenshots(white: true)
  upload_to_app_store
end
```

To get a list of all available options for _frame_screenshots_ (which calls into _frameit_)

```no-highlight
fastlane action frame_screenshots
```

# Advanced _snapshot_

<details> 
<summary>Sample uses</summary>

```ruby
lane :screenshots do
  capture_screenshots
end
```

Your screenshots will be stored in the `./screenshots/` folder by default (or `./fastlane/screenshots` if you're using [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools))

If any error occurs while running the snapshot script on a device, that device will not have any screenshots, and _snapshot_ will continue with the next device or language. To stop the flow after the first error, run

```ruby
capture_screenshots(stop_after_first_error: true)
```

Also by default, _snapshot_ will open the HTML after all is done. This can be skipped with the following command

```ruby
capture_screenshots(skip_open_summary: true)
```

There are a lot of options available that define how to build your app, for example

```ruby
capture_screenshots(scheme: "UITests", configuration: "Release", sdk: "iphonesimulator")
```

Reinstall the app before running _snapshot_

```ruby
capture_screenshots(reinstall_app: true, app_identifier: "tools.fastlane.app")
```

By default _snapshot_ automatically retries running UI Tests if they fail. This is due to randomly failing UI Tests (e.g. [#372](https://github.com/fastlane/snapshot/issues/372)). You can adapt this number using

```ruby
capture_screenshots(number_of_retries: 3)
```

Add photos and/or videos to the simulator before running _snapshot_

```ruby
capture_screenshots(add_photos: "MyTestApp/demo.jpg", add_videos: "MyTestApp/demo.mp4")
```

For a list for all available options run

```no-highlight
fastlane action capture_screenshots
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Reset Xcode simulators</summary>

You can run this command in the terminal to delete and re-create all iOS simulators. This is useful when Xcode duplicated your local simulators.

```no-highlight
fastlane snapshot reset_simulators
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Launch Arguments</summary>

You can provide additional arguments to your app on launch. These strings will be available in your app (eg. not in the testing target) through `NSProcessInfo.processInfo().arguments`. Alternatively, use user-default syntax (`-key value`) and they will be available as key-value pairs in `NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults()`.

```ruby
launch_arguments([
  "-firstName Felix -lastName Krause"
])
```

```swift
name.text = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().stringForKey("firstName")
// name.text = "Felix"
```

_snapshot_ includes `-FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT YES`, which will set a temporary user default for the key `FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT`, you may use this to detect when the app is run by _snapshot_.

```swift
if NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().boolForKey("FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT") {
    // runtime check that we are in snapshot mode
}
```

Specify multiple argument strings and _snapshot_ will generate screenshots for each combination of arguments, devices, and languages. This is useful for comparing the same screenshots with different feature flags, dynamic text sizes, and different data sets.

```ruby
# Snapfile for A/B Test Comparison
launch_arguments([
  "-secretFeatureEnabled YES",
  "-secretFeatureEnabled NO"
])
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Update snapshot helpers</summary>

Some updates require the helper files to be updated. _snapshot_ will automatically warn you and tell you how to update.

Basically you can run

```no-highlight
fastlane snapshot update
```

to update your `SnapshotHelper.swift` files. In case you modified your `SnapshotHelper.swift` and want to manually update the file, check out [SnapshotHelper.swift](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/snapshot/lib/assets/SnapshotHelper.swift).

<summary>Clean status bar</summary>

To clean the status bar (9:41, full battery and full signal), use [SimulatorStatusMagic](https://github.com/shinydevelopment/SimulatorStatusMagic).

<details>
<summary>How does _snapshot_ work?</summary>

The easiest solution would be to just render the UIWindow into a file. That's not possible because UI Tests don't run on a main thread. So _snapshot_ uses a different approach:

When you run unit tests in Xcode, the reporter generates a plist file, documenting all events that occurred during the tests ([More Information](http://michele.io/test-logs-in-xcode)). Additionally, Xcode generates screenshots before, during and after each of these events. There is no way to manually trigger a screenshot event. The screenshots and the plist files are stored in the DerivedData directory, which _snapshot_ stores in a temporary folder.

When the user calls `snapshot(...)` in the UI Tests (Swift or Objective C) the script actually does a rotation to `.Unknown` which doesn't have any effect on the actual app, but is enough to trigger a screenshot. It has no effect to the application and is not something you would do in your tests. The goal was to find *some* event that a user would never trigger, so that we know it's from _snapshot_. On tvOS, there is no orientation so we ask for a count of app views with type "Browser" (which should never exist on tvOS).

_snapshot_ then iterates through all test events and check where we either did this weird rotation (on iOS) or searched for browsers (on tvOS). Once _snapshot_ has all events triggered by _snapshot_ it collects a ordered list of all the file names of the actual screenshots of the application.

In the test output, the Swift _snapshot_ function will print out something like this

> snapshot: [some random text here]

_snapshot_ finds all these entries using a regex. The number of _snapshot_ outputs in the terminal and the number of _snapshot_ events in the plist file should be the same. Knowing that, _snapshot_ automatically matches these 2 lists to identify the name of each of these screenshots. They are then copied over to the output directory and separated by language and device.

Two things have to be passed on from _snapshot_ to the `xcodebuild` command line tool:

- The device type is passed via the `destination` parameter of the `xcodebuild` parameter
- The language is passed via a temporary file which is written by _snapshot_ before running the tests and read by the UI Tests when launching the application

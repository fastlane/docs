# Getting started with _fastlane_ for iOS

## Installing _fastlane_

Make sure you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

```no-highlight
xcode-select --install
```

Install _fastlane_ using 
```no-highlight
[sudo] gem install fastlane -NV
```
or alternatively using `brew cask install fastlane`

Navigate to your project directory and run

```no-highlight
fastlane init
```

## Setting up _fastlane_

Navigate your terminal to your project's directory and run

_for Ruby setup_:

```no-highlight
fastlane init
```

_for Swift setup:_

```no-highlight
fastlane init swift
```

**Swift setup is still in beta. See [Fastlane.swift docs](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/fastlane-swift/) for more information.**

Depending on what kind of setup you choose, different files will be set up for you. If you chose to download the existing app metadata, you'll end up new folders that look like this:

<img src="/img/getting-started/ios/fastlane-init.png" width="800" />

The most interesting file is `fastlane/Fastfile`, which contains all the information that is needed to distribute your app.

## What's next?

_fastlane_ created all the required files for you, now you can go ahead and customise it to generate screenshots or to automatically distribute new builds

- [Generate localized iOS screenshots for the App Store](screenshots.md)
- [Automatic iOS Beta deployment](beta-deployment.md)
- [Automatic iOS App Store deployment](appstore-deployment.md)

### Set up environment variables

_fastlane_ requires some environment variables set up to run correctly. In particular, having your locale not set to a UTF-8 locale will cause issues with building and uploading your build. In your shell profile add the following lines:

```sh
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

You can find your shell profile at `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` depending on your system. 

### Use a Gemfile

It is recommended that you use a `Gemfile` to define your dependency on _fastlane_. This will clearly define the used _fastlane_ version, and its dependencies, and will also speed up using _fastlane_.

- Create a `./Gemfile` in the root directory of your project with the content
```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "fastlane"
```
- Run `[sudo] bundle update` and add both the `./Gemfile` and the `./Gemfile.lock` to version control
- Every time you run _fastlane_, use `bundle exec fastlane [lane]`
- On your CI, add `[sudo] bundle install` as your first build step
- To update _fastlane_, just run `[sudo] bundle update fastlane`

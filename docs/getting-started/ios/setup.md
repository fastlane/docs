# Getting started with _fastlane_ for iOS

## Installing _fastlane_
Make sure you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

```no-highlight
xcode-select --install
```

### Choose your installation method:

| Method                     | OS support                              | Description                                                                                                                           |

| [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) | macOS                                   | `brew cask install fastlane`                                                                                                          |
| InstallerÂ Script           | macOS                                   | [Download the zip file](https://download.fastlane.tools). Then double click on the `install` script (or run it in a terminal window). |
| RubyGems                   | macOS or Linux with Ruby 2.0.0 or above | `sudo gem install fastlane -NV`                                                                                                       |

### Set up environment variables

_fastlane_ requires some environment variables set up to run correctly. In particular, having your locale not set to a UTF-8 locale will cause issues with building and uploading your build. In your shell profile add the following lines:

```sh
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

You can find your shell profile at `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` depending on your system. 

## Setting up _fastlane_

Navigate your terminal to your project's directory and run

_for Ruby setup_:

```no-highlight
fastlane init
```

_for Swift setup:_

```
fastlane init swift
```

** Swift setup is still in beta. See [Fastlane.swift docs](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/fastlane-swift/) for more information.

You'll be asked for your Apple ID, and _fastlane_ will automatically generate a fastlane configuration for you, based on the information provided.

You can see the newly created _fastlane_ directory, with all your existing metadata fetched from iTunes Connect.

The most interesting file is `fastlane/Fastfile`, which contains all the information that is needed to distribute your app.

## What's next?

_fastlane_ created all the required files for you, now you can go ahead and customise it to generate screenshots or to automatically distribute new builds

- [_fastlane_ screenshots for iOS and tvOS](screenshots.md)
- [iOS Beta deployment using _fastlane_](beta-deployment.md)
- [iOS App Store deployment using _fastlane_](appstore-deployment.md)

### Use a Gemfile

It is recommended that you use a `Gemfile` to define your dependency on _fastlane_. This will clearly define the used _fastlane_ version, and its dependencies, and will also speed up using _fastlane_.

- Install [bundler](https://bundler.io/) using `sudo gem install bundler`
- Create a `./Gemfile` in the root directory of your project with the content
```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "fastlane"
```
- Run `[sudo] bundle update` and add both the `./Gemfile` and the `./Gemfile.lock` to version control
- Every time you run _fastlane_, use `bundle exec fastlane [lane]`
- On your CI, add `[sudo] bundle install` as your first build step
- To update _fastlane_, just run `[sudo] bundle update`

# fastlane for Android

This guide will show you step by step how to get started with _fastlane_ for your Android project.

## Initial setup

Install _fastlane_ if you haven't already

    sudo gem install fastlane --verbose

Navigate your terminal to your project directory and run

```
fastlane init
```

Feel free to skip any of these inputs by submitting with empty without entering anything.

### Package Name

That's your package name, which usually looks something like `com.krausefx.app`

### Google Play Access

To enable _fastlane_ to access Google Play you have to follow these steps:

- Open the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/)
- Select **Settings** tab, followed by the **API access** tab
- Click the **Create Service Account** button and follow the **Google Developers Console** link in the dialog
- Click **Create credentials** and select **Service account**
- Select **JSON** as the Key type and click **Create**
- Make a note of the file name of the JSON file downloaded to your computer, and close the dialog
- Back on the Google Play developer console, click **Done** to close the dialog
- Click on **Grant Access** for the newly added service account
- Choose **Release Manager** from the **Role** dropdown and click **Send Invitation** to close the dialog

### JSON Key

The path to the json secret file that you're asked for should be the JSON file you downloaded from Google Play Console

### Finishing up

You'll be asked if you want to start using [supply](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/supply). Do it if you plan on upload screenshots or binaries to Google Play.

### Editing the configuration files

_fastlane_ created 2 important files and a metadata folder for you

##### `fastlane/Fastfile`

This file contains the actual deployment process. It defines which steps to run in which order. Check out [Actions.md](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/docs/Actions.md) for a list of all available actions.

##### `fastlane/Appfile`

Contains basic metadata of your app that can be used by the actions you define in your `Fastfile`

##### `fastlane/metadata/android`

This folder contains the metadata fetched from Google Play. You can modify any values here and run _supply_ to upload the updated metadata.

### Next Steps

Go ahead and modify the `Fastfile` to fit your needs. You might want to add the API Keys to your `crashlytics` action or your Slack URL to show notifications in your Slack room.

To get a list of all available actions run

```
fastlane actions --platform android
```

and to get more information about what a specific action does and the available parameters use

```
fastlane action [action_name]
```

This is often because taking screenshots of your app and then preparing them for display is time consuming, and it's hard to get everything right and consistent! For example:\n\n\n\n\nAre the screenshots in the App Store inconsistent with your latest app design?\n\n\nIs your app localized into many languages that require different screenshots for each?\n\n\nHave you made sure that no loading indicators are showing?\n\n\nIs the same content displayed for each of your size variations?\n\n\n\n\nfastlane\n tools can automate this process making it fast, and consistent while giving you beautiful results!\n\n\nAlternatives\n\n\nFor the full story about the many ways that developers can capture and beautify screenshots check out \nthis article\n.\n\n\nManually Capturing Screenshots\n\n\nManually taking screenshots takes too much time, which also decreases the quality of the screenshots. Since it is not automated, the screenshots will show slightly different content on the various devices and languages. Many companies choose to create screenshots in one language and use them for all languages. While this might seem okay to us developers, there are many potential users out there that cannot read the text on your app screenshots if they are not localised. Have you ever looked at a screenshots with content in a language you don't know? It won't convince you to download the app.\n\n\nHowever, the biggest disadvantage of this method is what happens when you need to repeat the process. If you notice a spelling mistake in the screenshots, if you release an update with a new design, or if you just want to show more up to date content, you'll have to create new screenshots for all languages and devices... manually.\n\n\nThe positive side of this approach is that your screenshots will all be crisp and correctly sized, with readable text.\n\n\nScaled Screenshots via iTunes Connect\n\n\nWith the \niTunes Connect screenshot update\n from August 2016, you can now use one set of screenshots for all available devices and screenshots. iTunes Connect will automatically scale the images for you, so that each device renders the same image.\n\n\nWhile this is convenient, this approach has the same problems as the device frame approach: The screenshots don't actually show how the app looks on the user's device. It's a valid way to start though, since you can gradually overwrite screenshots for specific languages and devices.\n\n\nCapture Screenshots Automatically\n\n\nsnapshot\n works with \nfastlane\n to automate the process of capturing screenshots of your app. It allows you to:\n\n\n\n\nCapture hundreds of screenshots in multiple languages on all simulators\n\n\nTake screenshots in multiple device simulators concurrently to cut down execution time (Xcode 9 only)\n\n\nDo something else while the computer takes the screenshots for you\n\n\nConfigure it once, and store the configuration so anyone on the team can run it\n\n\nGenerate a beautiful web page showing all screenshots on all devices. This is perfect to send to Q\nA, marketing, or translators for verification\n\n\nAvoid having loading indicators in your App Store screenshots by intelligently waiting for network requests to be finished\n\n\nGet a summary of how your app looks like across all supported devices and languages\n\n\n\n\nAfter \nsnapshot\n successfully captures all the screenshots, it will show you a beautiful HTML page to summarize all the screens that were captured:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nGetting Started Using UI Tests\n\n\nsnapshot\n uses the capabilities of Apple's UI Tests to drive interactions with your app. To get familiar with writing UI Tests, check out the following introductions:\n\n\n\n\nWWDC 2015 Introduction to UI Tests\n\n\nA first look into UI Tests\n\n\nUI Testing in Xcode 7\n\n\nHSTestingBackchannel : \u2018Cheat\u2019 by communicating directly with your app\n\n\nAutomating App Store screenshots using fastlane snapshot and frameit\n\n\n\n\nTo jump-start your UI tests, you can use the UI Test recorder, which you can start by clicking the red record button on the bottom of the window. By interacting with your app through the simulator while using it, Xcode will generate UI Test code for you. To learn more, check out this \nthis blog post\n!\n\n\nSetting Up \nsnapshot\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new UI Test target in your Xcode project (See the top part of \nthis article\n)\n\n\nRun \nfastlane snapshot init\n in your project folder\n\n\nAdd the \n./SnapshotHelper.swift\n file to your UI Test target (You can move the file anywhere you want)\n\n\nAdd a new Xcode scheme for the newly created UI Test target\n\n\nEdit the scheme\n\n\nIn the list on the left click \"Build\", and enable the checkbox under the \"Run\" column for your target. \n\n\nEnable the \nShared\n box of the newly created scheme\n\n\n(Objective C only) Add the bridging header to your test class.\n\n\n#import \"MYUITests-Swift.h\"\n\n\nThe bridging header is named after your test target with -Swift.h appended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your UI Test class, click the \nRecord\n button on the bottom left and record your interaction\n\n\nTo take a screenshot, call the following between interactions\n\n\nSwift: \nsnapshot(\"01LoginScreen\")\n\n\nObjective C: \n[Snapshot snapshot:@\"01LoginScreen\" waitForLoadingIndicator:YES];\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following code to your \nsetUp()\n method:\n\n\nSwift\n\n\nswift\nlet app = XCUIApplication()\nsetupSnapshot(app)\napp.launch()\n\n\nObjective C\n\n\nobjective-c\nXCUIApplication *app = [[XCUIApplication alloc] init];\n[Snapshot setupSnapshot:app];\n[app launch];\n\n1. In the terminal run \nfastlane snapshot\n.\n\nWARNING: Running the test in Xcode does not create the snapshots and will not generate the correct results - although no tests will fail.  The command line program creates the necessary subdirectories, renames the files as appropriate, and generates the overview html page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe setup process will also generate a \nSnapfile\n, looking similar to\n\n\n# A list of devices you want to take the screenshots from\n# devices([\n#   \niPhone 6\n,\n#   \niPhone 6 Plus\n,\n#   \niPhone 5\n,\n#   \niPhone 4s\n,\n#   \niPad Retina\n,\n#   \niPad Pro\n\n# ])\n\nlanguages([\n  \nen-US\n,\n  \nde-DE\n\n])\n\n# The name of the scheme which contains the UI Tests\n# scheme \nSchemeName\n\n\n# Where should the resulting screenshots be stored?\n# output_directory \n./screenshots\n\n\n# clear_previous_screenshots true # remove the '#' to clear all previously generated screenshots before creating new ones\n\n# Choose which project/workspace to use\n# project \n./Project.xcodeproj\n\n# workspace \n./Project.xcworkspace\n\n\n# For more information about all available options run\n# fastlane action snapshot\n\n\n\n\nYou can adapt this file to fit your project. Every time you run \nfastlane snapshot\n the file will be loaded automatically.\n\n\nFor a list of all available parameters that can be used in the \nSnapfile\n run \nfastlane action snapshot\n.\n\n\nIf you have \nfastlane\n installed, it's easy to give \nsnapshot\n a try. First clone the \nfastlane\n repo, head over to the \nsnapshot\n example project, and then run \nfastlane snapshot\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane  # Clone the fastlane repo\ncd fastlane/snapshot/example                    # Navigate to the example project\nfastlane snapshot                               # Generate screenshots for the sample app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload Screenshots to the App Store\n\n\nAfter generating your screenshots using \nfastlane snapshot\n, you usually want to upload them to iTunes Connect.\n\n\nIf you followed the setup guide, you already ran \nfastlane init\n before, so you should have your existing screenshots and metadata inside the \nfastlane/screenshots\n and \nfastlane/metadata\n directory. Running \nfastlane snapshot\n will store the screenshots in the \nfastlane/screenshots\n directory by default. \n\n\nTo upload the screenshots stored in \nfastlane/screenshots\n, just run\n\n\nfastlane deliver\n\n\n\n\nThis will also show you a metadata summary, before actually uploading the screenshots, as this will overwrite the metadata and screenshots you already have on iTunes Connect. \n\n\nUse in Fastfile\n\n\nTo put all of this together so that anyone on your team could trigger generating and uploading new screenshots, you can define a \nfastlane\n lane called \nscreenshots\n. It would be responsible for:\n\n\n\n\nRunning your app through \nsnapshot\n to automatically capture your screenshots\n\n\nHaving \ndeliver\n send your final screenshots to iTunes Connect for use in the App Store\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following code to your \nfastlane/Fastfile\n:\n\n\nlane :screenshots do\n  capture_screenshots\n  upload_to_app_store\nend\n\n\n\n\nTo get a list of all available options for each of the steps, run\n\n\nfastlane action capture_screenshots\nfastlane action upload_to_app_store\n\n\n\n\nPut Your Screenshots Into Device Frames\n\n\nframeit\n helps you beautify your screenshots with devices frames and text by running one simple command. It provides support for:\n\n\n\n\nMultiple device types\n\n\nPortrait and landscape orientations\n\n\nBlack and silver devices\n\n\nSetting a background color and decorating the image with text\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nAutomatically add device frames around all screenshots in the current directory and its subdirectories, just run\n\n\nfastlane frameit\n\n\n\n\nThis will only add a device frame around the screenshots, not the background and title. Those images can be used for your website, email newsletter and similar.\n\n\nIf you want to implement the custom titles and background, you'll have to setup a \nFramefile.json\n, more information can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nIf you want to upload the screenshots to the App Store, you \nhave\n to provide a \nFramefile.json\n, with titles and background, otherwise the resolution of the framed screenshots doesn't match the requirements of iTunes Connect.\n\n\nDependencies\n\n\n\n\nInstalling ImageMagick\n\n\nframeit\n depends on a tool called \nimagemagick\n to do image manipulation. The easiest way to install it is through \nhomebrew\n:\n\n\nbrew install libpng jpeg imagemagick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting ImageMagick\n\n\nIf you have installed \nimagemagick\n but are seeing error messages like:\n\n\nmogrify: no decode delegate for this image format `PNG'\n\n\n\n\nYou may need to reinstall and build from source. Run:\n\n\nbrew uninstall imagemagick; brew install libpng jpeg; brew install imagemagick --build-from-source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up Device Frames\n\n\nTo download the latest device frames, you can run\n\n\nfastlane frameit setup\n\n\n\n\nThis usually happens automatically when you use \nframeit\n for the first time on a new machine\n\n\n\n\nTo add the framing to your deployment process, use the following code in your \nFastfile\n:\n\n\nlane :screenshots do\n  capture_screenshots\n  frame_screenshots(white: true)\n  upload_to_app_store\nend\n\n\n\n\nTo get a list of all available options for \nframe_screenshots\n (which calls into \nframeit\n)\n\n\nfastlane action frame_screenshots\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced \nsnapshot\n\n\n \n\nSample uses\n\n\nlane :screenshots do\n  capture_screenshots\nend\n\n\n\n\nYour screenshots will be stored in the \n./screenshots/\n folder by default (or \n./fastlane/screenshots\n if you're using \nfastlane\n)\n\n\nIf any error occurs while running the snapshot script on a device, that device will not have any screenshots, and \nsnapshot\n will continue with the next device or language. To stop the flow after the first error, run\n\n\ncapture_screenshots(stop_after_first_error: true)\n\n\n\n\nAlso by default, \nsnapshot\n will open the HTML after all is done. This can be skipped with the following command\n\n\ncapture_screenshots(skip_open_summary: true)\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of options available that define how to build your app, for example\n\n\ncapture_screenshots(scheme: \nUITests\n, configuration: \nRelease\n, sdk: \niphonesimulator\n)\n\n\n\n\nReinstall the app before running \nsnapshot\n\n\ncapture_screenshots(reinstall_app: true, app_identifier: \ntools.fastlane.app\n)\n\n\n\n\nBy default \nsnapshot\n automatically retries running UI Tests if they fail. This is due to randomly failing UI Tests (e.g. \n#372\n). You can adapt this number using\n\n\ncapture_screenshots(number_of_retries: 3)\n\n\n\n\nAdd photos and/or videos to the simulator before running \nsnapshot\n\n\ncapture_screenshots(add_photos: \nMyTestApp/demo.jpg\n, add_videos: \nMyTestApp/demo.mp4\n)\n\n\n\n\nFor a list for all available options run\n\n\nfastlane action capture_screenshots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReset Xcode simulators\n\n\nYou can run this command in the terminal to delete and re-create all iOS simulators. This is useful when Xcode duplicated your local simulators.\n\n\nfastlane snapshot reset_simulators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunch Arguments\n\n\nYou can provide additional arguments to your app on launch. These strings will be available in your app (eg. not in the testing target) through \nNSProcessInfo.processInfo().arguments\n. Alternatively, use user-default syntax (\n-key value\n) and they will be available as key-value pairs in \nNSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults()\n.\n\n\nlaunch_arguments([\n  \n-firstName Felix -lastName Krause\n\n])\n\n\n\n\nname.text = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().stringForKey(\nfirstName\n)\n// name.text = \nFelix\n\n\n\n\n\nsnapshot\n includes \n-FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT YES\n, which will set a temporary user default for the key \nFASTLANE_SNAPSHOT\n, you may use this to detect when the app is run by \nsnapshot\n.\n\n\nif NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().boolForKey(\nFASTLANE_SNAPSHOT\n) {\n    // runtime check that we are in snapshot mode\n}\n\n\n\n\nSpecify multiple argument strings and \nsnapshot\n will generate screenshots for each combination of arguments, devices, and languages. This is useful for comparing the same screenshots with different feature flags, dynamic text sizes, and different data sets.\n\n\n# Snapfile for A/B Test Comparison\nlaunch_arguments([\n  \n-secretFeatureEnabled YES\n,\n  \n-secretFeatureEnabled NO\n\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate snapshot helpers\n\n\nSome updates require the helper files to be updated. \nsnapshot\n will automatically warn you and tell you how to update.\n\n\nBasically you can run\n\n\nfastlane snapshot update\n\n\n\n\nto update your \nSnapshotHelper.swift\n files. In case you modified your \nSnapshotHelper.swift\n and want to manually update the file, check out \nSnapshotHelper.swift\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean status bar\n\n\nTo clean the status bar (9:41, full battery and full signal), use \nSimulatorStatusMagic\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does \nsnapshot\n work?\n\n\nThe easiest solution would be to just render the UIWindow into a file. That's not possible because UI Tests don't run on a main thread. So \nsnapshot\n uses a different approach:\n\n\nWhen you run unit tests in Xcode, the reporter generates a plist file, documenting all events that occurred during the tests (\nMore Information\n). Additionally, Xcode generates screenshots before, during and after each of these events. There is no way to manually trigger a screenshot event. The screenshots and the plist files are stored in the DerivedData directory, which \nsnapshot\n stores in a temporary folder.\n\n\nWhen the user calls \nsnapshot(...)\n in the UI Tests (Swift or Objective C) the script actually does a rotation to \n.Unknown\n which doesn't have any effect on the actual app, but is enough to trigger a screenshot. It has no effect to the application and is not something you would do in your tests. The goal was to find \nsome\n event that a user would never trigger, so that we know it's from \nsnapshot\n. On tvOS, there is no orientation so we ask for a count of app views with type \"Browser\" (which should never exist on tvOS).\n\n\nsnapshot\n then iterates through all test events and check where we either did this weird rotation (on iOS) or searched for browsers (on tvOS). Once \nsnapshot\n has all events triggered by \nsnapshot\n it collects a ordered list of all the file names of the actual screenshots of the application.\n\n\nIn the test output, the Swift \nsnapshot\n function will print out something like this\n\n\n\n\nsnapshot: [some random text here]\n\n\n\n\nsnapshot\n finds all these entries using a regex. The number of \nsnapshot\n outputs in the terminal and the number of \nsnapshot\n events in the plist file should be the same. Knowing that, \nsnapshot\n automatically matches these 2 lists to identify the name of each of these screenshots. They are then copied over to the output directory and separated by language and device.\n\n\nTwo things have to be passed on from \nsnapshot\n to the \nxcodebuild\n command line tool:\n\n\n\n\nThe device type is passed via the \ndestination\n parameter of the \nxcodebuild\n parameter\n\n\nThe language is passed via a temporary file which is written by \nsnapshot\n before running the tests and read by the UI Tests when launching the application\n\n\n\n\nIf you find a better way to do any of this, please submit an issue on GitHub or even a pull request :+1:\n\n\nAlso, feel free to duplicate radar \n23062925\n.",

It won't convince you to download the app.  However, the biggest disadvantage of this method is what happens when you need to repeat the process. If you notice a spelling mistake in the screenshots, if you release an update with a new design, or if you just want to show more up to date content, you'll have to create new screenshots for all languages and devices... manually.  The positive side of this approach is that your screenshots will all be crisp and correctly sized, with readable text.",

Basically you can run  fastlane snapshot update  to update your  SnapshotHelper.swift  files. In case you modified your  SnapshotHelper.swift  and want to manually update the file, check out  SnapshotHelper.swift .    Clean status bar  To clean the status bar (9:41, full battery and full signal), use  SimulatorStatusMagic .    How does  snapshot  work?  The easiest solution would be to just render the UIWindow into a file. That's not possible because UI Tests don't run on a main thread. So  snapshot  uses a different approach:  When you run unit tests in Xcode, the reporter generates a plist file, documenting all events that occurred during the tests ( More Information ). Additionally, Xcode generates screenshots before, during and after each of these events. There is no way to manually trigger a screenshot event. The screenshots and the plist files are stored in the DerivedData directory, which  snapshot  stores in a temporary folder.  When the user calls  snapshot(...)  in the UI Tests (Swift or Objective C) the script actually does a rotation to  .Unknown  which doesn't have any effect on the actual app, but is enough to trigger a screenshot. It has no effect to the application and is not something you would do in your tests. The goal was to find  some  event that a user would never trigger, so that we know it's from  snapshot . On tvOS, there is no orientation so we ask for a count of app views with type \"Browser\" (which should never exist on tvOS).  snapshot  then iterates through all test events and check where we either did this weird rotation (on iOS) or searched for browsers (on tvOS). Once  snapshot  has all events triggered by  snapshot  it collects a ordered list of all the file names of the actual screenshots of the application.  In the test output, the Swift  snapshot  function will print out something like this   snapshot: [some random text here]   snapshot  finds all these entries using a regex. The number of  snapshot  outputs in the terminal and the number of  snapshot  events in the plist file should be the same. Knowing that,  snapshot  automatically matches these 2 lists to identify the name of each of these screenshots. They are then copied over to the output directory and separated by language and device.  Two things have to be passed on from  snapshot  to the  xcodebuild  command line tool:   The device type is passed via the  destination  parameter of the  xcodebuild  parameter  The language is passed via a temporary file which is written by  snapshot  before running the tests and read by the UI Tests when launching the application   If you find a better way to do any of this, please submit an issue on GitHub or even a pull request :+1:  Also, feel free to duplicate radar  23062925 .",

This is a requirement for TestFlight for example.\n\n\nTo do so, there are some built-in fastlane actions available, here are some examples\n\n\nFetching the latest build number from TestFlight\n\n\nThe code sample below will use the latest build number from TestFlight and temporarily set it. \n\n\nlane :beta do\n  increment_build_number(\n    build_number: latest_testflight_build_number + 1,\n    xcodeproj: \nExample.xcodeproj\n\n  )\nend\n\n\n\n\nCommitting the build number to version control\n\n\nThe code sample below will increment the build number and commit the project changes to version control.\n\n\nlane :beta do\n  # Ensure that your git status is not dirty\n  ensure_git_status_clean\n\n  # Increment the build number (not the version number)\n  # Providing the xcodeproj is optional\n  increment_build_number(xcodeproj: \nExample.xcodeproj\n)\n\n  # Commit the version bump\n  commit_version_bump(xcodeproj: \nExample.xcodeproj\n)\n\n  # Add a git tag for this build.

This is often because taking screenshots of your app and then preparing them for display is time consuming, and it's hard to get everything right and consistent! For example:\n\n\n\n\nAre the screenshots in Google Play inconsistent with your latest app design?\n\n\nIs your app localized into many languages that require different screenshots for each?\n\n\nIs the same content displayed for each of your size variations?\n\n\n\n\nfastlane\n tools can automate this process, making it fast and consistent while giving you beautiful results!\n\n\n\n\nCapture Screenshots Automatically\n\n\nscreengrab\n works with \nfastlane\n to automate the process of capturing screenshots of your app. It allows you to:\n\n\n\n\nCapture hundreds of screenshots in multiple languages on any simulator\n\n\nDo something else while the computer takes the screenshots for you\n\n\nConfigure it once, and store the configuration so anyone on the team can run it\n\n\nGet a summary of how your app looks like across all supported devices and languages\n\n\n\n\nAfter \nscreengrab\n completes, it will show you summary of the screenshots you captured:\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started Using Espresso\n\n\nscreengrab\n uses the capabilities of Android's built-in \nInstrumented tests\n combined with \nEspresso\n to drive interactions with your app. \n\n\nTo get started with writing UI Tests with Espresso, Checkout the \nCreate UI tests with Espresso Test Recorder\n video which talks about the Espresso Recording feature for writing UI tests. To learn more about UI testing in Android, refer to the \nTesting UI for a Single App\n guide.\n\n\nInstalling \nscreengrab\n\n\nInstall the gem:\n\n\nsudo gem install screengrab\n\n\n\n\nGradle dependency\n\n\nAdd the test dependency to your Gradle build:\n\n\nandroidTestCompile 'tools.fastlane:screengrab:x.x.x'\n\n\n\n\nThe latest version can be determined by visiting the \nscreengrab\n RubyGems page\n\n\nConfiguring your Manifest Permissions\n\n\nEnsure that the following permissions exist in your \nsrc/debug/AndroidManifest.xml\n\n\n!-- Allows unlocking your device and activating its screen so UI tests can succeed --\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.DISABLE_KEYGUARD\n/\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.WAKE_LOCK\n/\n\n\n\n!-- Allows for storing and retrieving screenshots --\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\n /\n\n\n\n!-- Allows changing locales --\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.CHANGE_CONFIGURATION\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring your UI Tests for \nscreengrab\n\n\n\n\nTo handle automatic switching of locales, add \n@ClassRule public static final LocaleTestRule localeTestRule = new LocaleTestRule();\n to /app/java/\n(AndroidTest)/ExampleInstrumentedTest.java or to your tests class \n\n\nTo capture screenshots, add the following to your tests \nScreengrab.screenshot(\"name_of_screenshot_here\");\n on the appropriate screens\n\n\n\n\nExample UI Test Class (Using JUnit4)\n\n\n@RunWith(JUnit4.class)\npublic class ExampleInstrumentedTest {\n    @ClassRule\n    public static final LocaleTestRule localeTestRule = new LocaleTestRule();\n\n    @Rule\n    public ActivityTestRule\nMainActivity\n activityRule = new ActivityTestRule\n(MainActivity.class);\n\n    @Test\n    public void testTakeScreenshot() {\n        Screengrab.screenshot(\nbefore_button_click\n);\n\n        // Your custom onView...\n        onView(withId(R.id.fab)).perform(click());\n\n        Screengrab.screenshot(\nafter_button_click\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an \nexample project\n showing how to use use JUnit 3 or 4 and Espresso with the screengrab Java library to capture screenshots during a UI test run.\n\n\nUsing JUnit 4 is preferable because of its ability to perform actions before and after the entire test class is run. This means you will change the device's locale far fewer times when compared with JUnit 3 running those commands before and after each test method.\n\n\nWhen using JUnit 3 you'll need to add a bit more code:\n\n\n\n\nUse \nLocaleUtil.changeDeviceLocaleTo(LocaleUtil.getTestLocale());\n in \nsetUp()\n\n\nUse \nLocaleUtil.changeDeviceLocaleTo(LocaleUtil.getEndingLocale());\n in \ntearDown()\n\n\nUse \nScreengrab.screenshot(\"name_of_screenshot_here\");\n to capture screenshots at the appropriate points in your tests\n\n\n\n\nIf you're having trouble getting your device unlocked and the screen activated to run tests, try using \nScreenUtil.activateScreenForTesting(activity);\n in your test setup.\n\n\nImproved screenshot capture with UI Automator\n\n\nAs of \nscreengrab\n 0.5.0, you can specify different strategies to control the way \nscreengrab\n captures screenshots.

localized value.\n\n\nIn order to use \ndefault\n, you will need to tell \ndeliver\n which languages your app uses. You can do this in either of two ways:\n1. Create the folders named with the language in the metadata folder (i.e. fastlane/metadata/en-US or fastlane/metadata/de-DE)\n2. Add the following to your \nDeliverfile\n \nlanguages(['en-US','de-DE'])\n\n\nYou can use this either in json within your \nDeliverfile\n and/or as folders in your metadata folder. \ndeliver\n will take the union of both language sets from the \nDeliverfile\n and from the metadata folder and create on single set of languages which will be enabled.\n\n\nImagine that you have localized data for the following language codes:  \nen-US, de-DE, el, it\n\n\nYou can set the following in your \nDeliverfile\n\n\nrelease_notes({\n  'default' =\n \nShiny and new\n,\n  'de-DE' =\n \nglaenzend und neu\n\n})\n\n\n\n\nDeliver will use \"Shiny and new\" for en-US, el and it.\n\n\nIt will use \"glaenzend und neu\" for de-DE.\n\n\nYou can do the same with folders\n\n\n   default\n      keywords.txt\n      marketing_url.txt\n      name.txt\n      privacy_url.txt\n      support_url.txt\n      release_notes.txt\n   en-US\n      description.txt\n   de-DE\n      description.txt\n   el\n      description.txt\n   it\n      description.txt\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, default values for keywords, urls, name and release notes are used in all localizations, but each language has a fully localized description\n\n\nAutomatically create screenshots\n\n\nIf you want to integrate \ndeliver\n with \nsnapshot\n, check out \nfastlane\n!\n\n\nJenkins integration\n\n\nDetailed instructions about how to set up \ndeliver\n and \nfastlane\n in \nJenkins\n can be found in the \nfastlane README\n.\n\n\nFirewall Issues\n\n\ndeliver\n uses the iTunes Transporter to upload metadata and binaries. In case you are behind a firewall, you can specify a different transporter protocol using\n\n\nDELIVER_ITMSTRANSPORTER_ADDITIONAL_UPLOAD_PARAMETERS=\n-t DAV\n fastlane deliver\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Proxy\n\n\niTunes Transporter is a Java application bundled with Xcode. In addition to utilizing the \nDELIVER_ITMSTRANSPORTER_ADDITIONAL_UPLOAD_PARAMETERS=\"-t DAV\"\n, you need to configure the transporter application to use the proxy independently from the system proxy or any environment proxy settings. You can find the configuration file within Xcode:\n\n\nTOOLS_PATH=$( xcode-select -p )\nREL_PATH='../Applications/Application Loader.app/Contents/itms/java/lib/net.properties'\necho \n$TOOLS_PATH/$REL_PATH\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd necessary proxy configuration values to the net.properties according to \nJava Proxy Configuration\n.\n\n\nAs an alternative to editing the properties files, proxy configuration can be specified on the command line directly:\n\n\nDELIVER_ITMSTRANSPORTER_ADDITIONAL_UPLOAD_PARAMETERS=\n-t DAV -Dhttp.proxyHost=myproxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080\n\n\n\n\n\nLimit\n\n\niTunes Connect has a limit of 150 binary uploads per day.\n\n\nEditing the \nDeliverfile\n\n\nChange syntax highlighting to \nRuby\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nappstore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\n\nios, mac\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n@KrauseFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Examples\n\n\nupload_to_app_store(\n  force: true, # Set to true to skip PDF verification\n  itc_provider: \nabcde12345\n # pass a specific value to the iTMSTransporter -itc_provider option\n)\n\n\n\n\ndeliver   # alias for \nupload_to_app_store\n\n\n\n\n\nappstore  # alias for \nupload_to_app_store\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusername\n\n\nYour Apple ID Username\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp_identifier\n\n\nThe bundle identifier of your app\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp\n\n\nThe app ID of the app you want to use/modify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedit_live\n\n\nModify live metadata, this option disables ipa upload and screenshot upload\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nipa\n\n\nPath to your ipa file\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg\n\n\nPath to your pkg file\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplatform\n\n\nThe platform to use (optional)\n\n\nios\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata_path\n\n\nPath to the folder containing the metadata files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscreenshots_path\n\n\nPath to the folder containing the screenshots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_binary_upload\n\n\nSkip uploading an ipa or pkg to iTunes Connect\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse_live_version\n\n\nForce usage of live version rather than edit version\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_screenshots\n\n\nDon't upload the screenshots\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp_version\n\n\nThe version that should be edited or created\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_metadata\n\n\nDon't upload the metadata (e.g. title, description).

If you want more control, here are some available parameters:\n\n\nfastlane gym --workspace \nExample.xcworkspace\n --scheme \nAppName\n --clean\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to use a different Xcode installation, use \nxcode-select\n or define \nDEVELOPER_DIR\n:\n\n\nDEVELOPER_DIR=\n/Applications/Xcode6.2.app\n fastlane gym\n\n\n\n\nFor a list of all available parameters use\n\n\nfastlane action gym\n\n\n\n\nIf you run into any issues, use the \nverbose\n mode to get more information\n\n\nfastlane gym --verbose\n\n\n\n\nSet the right export method if you're not uploading to App Store or TestFlight:\n\n\nfastlane gym --export_method ad-hoc\n\n\n\n\nTo pass boolean parameters make sure to use \ngym\n like this:\n\n\nfastlane gym --include_bitcode true --include_symbols false\n\n\n\n\nTo access the raw \nxcodebuild\n output open \n~/Library/Logs/gym\n\n\nGymfile\n\n\nSince you might want to manually trigger a new build but don't want to specify all the parameters every time, you can store your defaults in a so called \nGymfile\n.\n\n\nRun \nfastlane gym init\n to create a new configuration file. Example:\n\n\nscheme(\nExample\n)\n\nsdk(\niphoneos9.0\n)\n\nclean(true)\n\noutput_directory(\n./build\n)    # store the ipa in this folder\noutput_name(\nMyApp\n)           # the name of the ipa file\n\n\n\n\nExport options\n\n\nSince Xcode 7, \ngym\n is using new Xcode API which allows us to specify export options using \nplist\n file. By default \ngym\n creates this file for you and you are able to modify some parameters by using \nexport_method\n, \nexport_team_id\n, \ninclude_symbols\n or \ninclude_bitcode\n. If you want to have more options, like creating manifest file for app thinning, you can provide your own \nplist\n file:\n\n\nexport_options(\n./ExportOptions.plist\n)\n\n\n\n\nor you can provide hash of values directly in the \nGymfile\n:\n\n\nexport_options(\n  method: \nad-hoc\n,\n  manifest: {\n    appURL: \nhttps://example.com/My App.ipa\n,\n  },\n  thinning: \nthin-for-all-variants\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nOptional: If \ngym\n can't automatically detect the provisioning profiles to use, you can pass a mapping of bundle identifiers to provisioning profiles:\n\n\nexport_options(\n  method: \napp-store\n,\n  provisioningProfiles: { \n    \ncom.example.bundleid\n =\n \nProvisioning Profile Name\n,\n    \ncom.example.bundleid2\n =\n \nProvisioning Profile Name 2\n\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: If you use \nfastlane\n with \nmatch\n you don't need to provide those values manually.\n\n\nFor the list of available options run \nxcodebuild -help\n.\n\n\nSetup code signing\n\n\n\n\nMore information on how to get started with codesigning\n\n\nDocs on how to set up your Xcode project\n\n\n\n\nAutomating the whole process\n\n\ngym\n works great together with \nfastlane\n, which connects all deployment tools into one streamlined workflow.\n\n\nUsing \nfastlane\n you can define a configuration like\n\n\nlane :beta do\n  scan\n  gym(scheme: \nMyApp\n)\n  crashlytics\nend\n\n# error block is executed when a error occurs\nerror do |lane, exception|\n  slack(\n    # message with short human friendly message\n    message: exception.to_s, \n    success: false, \n    # Output containing extended log output\n    payload: { \nOutput\n =\n exception.error_info.to_s } \n  )\nend\n\n\n\n\nWhen \ngym\n raises an error the \nerror_info\n property will contain the process output\nin case you want to display the error in 3rd party tools such as Slack.\n\n\nYou can then easily switch between the beta provider (e.g. \ntestflight\n, \nhockey\n, \ns3\n and more).\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\ngym\n uses the latest APIs to build and sign your application. The 2 main components are\n\n\n\n\nxcodebuild\n\n\nxcpretty\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run \ngym\n without the \n--silent\n mode it will print out every command it executes.\n\n\nTo build the archive \ngym\n uses the following command:\n\n\nset -o pipefail \n \\\nxcodebuild -scheme 'Example' \\\n-project './Example.xcodeproj' \\\n-configuration 'Release' \\\n-destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \\\n-archivePath '/Users/felixkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-08-11/ExampleProductName 2015-08-11 18.15.30.xcarchive' \\\narchive | xcpretty\n\n\n\n\nAfter building the archive it is being checked by \ngym\n. If it's valid, it gets packaged up and signed into an \nipa\n file.\n\n\ngym\n automatically chooses a different packaging method depending on the version of Xcode you're using.\n\n\nXcode 7 and above\n\n\n/usr/bin/xcrun path/to/xcbuild-safe.sh -exportArchive \\\n-exportOptionsPlist '/tmp/gym_config_1442852529.plist' \\\n-archivePath '/Users/fkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-09-21/App 2015-09-21 09.21.56.xcarchive' \\\n-exportPath '/tmp/1442852529'\n\n\n\n\ngym\n makes use of the new Xcode 7 API which allows us to specify the export options using a \nplist\n file. You can find more information about the available options by running \nxcodebuild --help\n.\n\n\nUsing this method there are no workarounds for WatchKit or Swift required, as it uses the same technique Xcode uses when exporting your binary.\n\n\nNote: the \nxcbuild-safe.sh script\n wraps around xcodebuild to workaround some incompatibilities.\n\n\nUse the 'Provisioning Quicklook plugin'\n\n\nDownload and install the \nProvisioning Plugin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbuild_app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\n\nios, mac\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n@KrauseFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n\n\nThe absolute path to the generated ipa file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Examples\n\n\nbuild_ios_app(scheme: \nMyApp\n, workspace: \nMyApp.xcworkspace\n)\n\n\n\n\nbuild_ios_app(\n  workspace: \nMyApp.xcworkspace\n,\n  configuration: \nDebug\n,\n  scheme: \nMyApp\n,\n  silent: true,\n  clean: true,\n  output_directory: \npath/to/dir\n, # Destination directory.

If you want to have more options, like creating manifest file for app thinning, you can provide your own \nplist\n file:\n\n\nexport_options(\n./ExportOptions.plist\n)\n\n\n\n\nor you can provide hash of values directly in the \nGymfile\n:\n\n\nexport_options(\n  method: \nad-hoc\n,\n  manifest: {\n    appURL: \nhttps://example.com/My App.ipa\n,\n  },\n  thinning: \nthin-for-all-variants\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nOptional: If \ngym\n can't automatically detect the provisioning profiles to use, you can pass a mapping of bundle identifiers to provisioning profiles:\n\n\nexport_options(\n  method: \napp-store\n,\n  provisioningProfiles: { \n    \ncom.example.bundleid\n =\n \nProvisioning Profile Name\n,\n    \ncom.example.bundleid2\n =\n \nProvisioning Profile Name 2\n\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: If you use \nfastlane\n with \nmatch\n you don't need to provide those values manually.\n\n\nFor the list of available options run \nxcodebuild -help\n.\n\n\nSetup code signing\n\n\n\n\nMore information on how to get started with codesigning\n\n\nDocs on how to set up your Xcode project\n\n\n\n\nAutomating the whole process\n\n\ngym\n works great together with \nfastlane\n, which connects all deployment tools into one streamlined workflow.\n\n\nUsing \nfastlane\n you can define a configuration like\n\n\nlane :beta do\n  scan\n  gym(scheme: \nMyApp\n)\n  crashlytics\nend\n\n# error block is executed when a error occurs\nerror do |lane, exception|\n  slack(\n    # message with short human friendly message\n    message: exception.to_s, \n    success: false, \n    # Output containing extended log output\n    payload: { \nOutput\n =\n exception.error_info.to_s } \n  )\nend\n\n\n\n\nWhen \ngym\n raises an error the \nerror_info\n property will contain the process output\nin case you want to display the error in 3rd party tools such as Slack.\n\n\nYou can then easily switch between the beta provider (e.g. \ntestflight\n, \nhockey\n, \ns3\n and more).\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\ngym\n uses the latest APIs to build and sign your application. The 2 main components are\n\n\n\n\nxcodebuild\n\n\nxcpretty\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run \ngym\n without the \n--silent\n mode it will print out every command it executes.\n\n\nTo build the archive \ngym\n uses the following command:\n\n\nset -o pipefail \n \\\nxcodebuild -scheme 'Example' \\\n-project './Example.xcodeproj' \\\n-configuration 'Release' \\\n-destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \\\n-archivePath '/Users/felixkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-08-11/ExampleProductName 2015-08-11 18.15.30.xcarchive' \\\narchive | xcpretty\n\n\n\n\nAfter building the archive it is being checked by \ngym\n. If it's valid, it gets packaged up and signed into an \nipa\n file.\n\n\ngym\n automatically chooses a different packaging method depending on the version of Xcode you're using.\n\n\nXcode 7 and above\n\n\n/usr/bin/xcrun path/to/xcbuild-safe.sh -exportArchive \\\n-exportOptionsPlist '/tmp/gym_config_1442852529.plist' \\\n-archivePath '/Users/fkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-09-21/App 2015-09-21 09.21.56.xcarchive' \\\n-exportPath '/tmp/1442852529'\n\n\n\n\ngym\n makes use of the new Xcode 7 API which allows us to specify the export options using a \nplist\n file.

We will not go into detail on how to write scripts.\n\n\nHere a few links to get started:\n\n\n\n\nWWDC 2015 Introduction to UI Tests\n\n\nA first look into UI Tests\n\n\nUI Testing in Xcode 7\n\n\nHSTestingBackchannel : \u2018Cheat\u2019 by communicating directly with your app\n\n\nAutomating App Store screenshots using fastlane snapshot and frameit\n\n\n\n\nQuick Start\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new UI Test target in your Xcode project (\ntop part of this article\n)\n\n\nRun \nfastlane snapshot init\n in your project folder\n\n\nAdd the ./SnapshotHelper.swift to your UI Test target (You can move the file anywhere you want)\n\n\n(Xcode 8 only) add the ./SnapshotHelperXcode8.swift to your UI Test target\n\n\n(Objective C only) add the bridging header to your test class:\n\n\n#import \"MYUITests-Swift.h\"\n\n    (The bridging header is named after your test target with \n-Swift.h\n appended.)\n\n\nIn your UI Test class, click the \nRecord\n button on the bottom left and record your interaction\n\n\nTo take a snapshot, call the following between interactions\n\n\nSwift: \nsnapshot(\"01LoginScreen\")\n\n\nObjective C: \n[Snapshot snapshot:@\"01LoginScreen\" timeWaitingForIdle:10];\n\n\nAdd the following code to your \nsetUp()\n method:\n\n\nSwift:\n    \nswift\n    let app = XCUIApplication()\n    setupSnapshot(app)\n    app.launch()\n\n\nObjective C:\n\n\nobjective-c\n    XCUIApplication *app = [[XCUIApplication alloc] init];\n    [Snapshot setupSnapshot:app];\n    [app launch];\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you only have one \nlaunch\n call in your test class, as Xcode adds one automatically on new test files.\n\n\n\n\nYou can try the \nsnapshot\n \nexample project\n by cloning this repo.\n\n\nTo quick start your UI tests, you can use the UI Test recorder. You only have to interact with the simulator, and Xcode will generate the UI Test code for you. You can find the red record button on the bottom of the screen (more information in \nthis blog post\n)\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nfastlane snapshot\n\n\n\n\nYour screenshots will be stored in the \n./screenshots/\n folder by default (or \n./fastlane/screenshots\n if you're using \nfastlane\n)\n\n\nNew with Xcode 9, \nsnapshot\n can run multiple simulators concurrently. This is the default behavior in order to take your screenshots as quickly as possible. This can be disabled to run each device, one at a time, by setting the \n:concurrent_simulators\n option to \nfalse\n.\n\n\nNote:\n While running \nsnapshot\n with Xcode 9, the simulators will not be visibly spawned. So, while you wont see the simulators running your tests, they will, in fact, be taking your screenshots.\n\n\nIf any error occurs while running the snapshot script on a device, that device will not have any screenshots, and \nsnapshot\n will continue with the next device or language. To stop the flow after the first error, run\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --stop_after_first_error\n\n\n\n\nAlso by default, \nsnapshot\n will open the HTML after all is done. This can be skipped with the following command\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --stop_after_first_error --skip_open_summary\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of options available that define how to build your app, for example\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --scheme \nUITests\n --configuration \nRelease\n  --sdk \niphonesimulator\n\n\n\n\n\nReinstall the app before running \nsnapshot\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --reinstall_app --app_identifier \ntools.fastlane.app\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default \nsnapshot\n automatically retries running UI Tests if they fail. This is due to randomly failing UI Tests (e.g. \n#2517\n). You can adapt this number using\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --number_of_retries 3\n\n\n\n\nAdd photos and/or videos to the simulator before running \nsnapshot\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --add_photos MyTestApp/Assets/demo.jpg --add_videos MyTestApp/Assets/demo.mp4\n\n\n\n\nFor a list for all available options run\n\n\nfastlane action snapshot\n\n\n\n\nAfter running \nsnapshot\n you will get a nice summary:\n\n\n\n\nSnapfile\n\n\nAll of the available options can also be stored in a configuration file called the \nSnapfile\n. Since most values will not change often for your project, it is recommended to store them there:\n\n\nFirst make sure to have a \nSnapfile\n (you get it for free when running \nfastlane snapshot init\n)\n\n\nThe \nSnapfile\n can contain all the options that are also available on \nfastlane action snapshot\n\n\nscheme(\nUITests\n)\n\ndevices([\n  \niPhone 6\n,\n  \niPhone 6 Plus\n,\n  \niPhone 5\n,\n  \niPhone 4s\n\n])\n\nlanguages([\n  \nen-US\n,\n  \nde-DE\n,\n  \nes-ES\n,\n  [\npt\n, \npt_BR\n] # Portuguese with Brazilian locale\n])\n\nlaunch_arguments([\n-username Felix\n])\n\n# The directory in which the screenshots should be stored\noutput_directory('./screenshots')\n\nclear_previous_screenshots(true)\n\nadd_photos([\nMyTestApp/Assets/demo.jpg\n])\n\n\n\n\nCompletely reset all simulators\n\n\nYou can run this command in the terminal to delete and re-create all iOS and tvOS simulators:\n\n\nfastlane snapshot reset_simulators\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n: This will delete \nall\n your simulators and replace by new ones! This is useful, if you run into weird problems when running \nsnapshot\n.\n\n\nYou can use the environment variable \nSNAPSHOT_FORCE_DELETE\n to stop asking for confirmation before deleting.\n\n\nSNAPSHOT_FORCE_DELETE=1 fastlane snapshot reset_simulators\n\n\n\n\nUpdate snapshot helpers\n\n\nSome updates require the helper files to be updated. \nsnapshot\n will automatically warn you and tell you how to update.\n\n\nBasically you can run\n\n\nfastlane snapshot update\n\n\n\n\nto update your \nSnapshotHelper.swift\n files. In case you modified your \nSnapshotHelper.swift\n and want to manually update the file, check out \nSnapshotHelper.swift\n.\n\n\nLaunch Arguments\n\n\nYou can provide additional arguments to your app on launch. These strings will be available in your app (eg. not in the testing target) through \nProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments\n. Alternatively, use user-default syntax (\n-key value\n) and they will be available as key-value pairs in \nUserDefaults.standard\n.\n\n\nlaunch_arguments([\n  \n-firstName Felix -lastName Krause\n\n])\n\n\n\n\nname.text = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: \nfirstName\n)\n// name.text = \nFelix\n\n\n\n\n\nsnapshot\n includes \n-FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT YES\n, which will set a temporary user default for the key \nFASTLANE_SNAPSHOT\n, you may use this to detect when the app is run by \nsnapshot\n.\n\n\nif UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: \nFASTLANE_SNAPSHOT\n) {\n    // runtime check that we are in snapshot mode\n}\n\n\n\n\nSpecify multiple argument strings and \nsnapshot\n will generate screenshots for each combination of arguments, devices, and languages. This is useful for comparing the same screenshots with different feature flags, dynamic text sizes, and different data sets.\n\n\n# Snapfile for A/B Test Comparison\nlaunch_arguments([\n  \n-secretFeatureEnabled YES\n,\n  \n-secretFeatureEnabled NO\n\n])\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\nThe easiest solution would be to just render the UIWindow into a file. That's not possible because UI Tests don't run on a main thread. So \nsnapshot\n uses a different approach:\n\n\nWhen you run unit tests in Xcode, the reporter generates a plist file, documenting all events that occurred during the tests (\nMore Information\n). Additionally, Xcode generates screenshots before, during and after each of these events. There is no way to manually trigger a screenshot event. The screenshots and the plist files are stored in the DerivedData directory, which \nsnapshot\n stores in a temporary folder.\n\n\nWhen the user calls \nsnapshot(...)\n in the UI Tests (Swift or Objective C) the script actually does a rotation to \n.Unknown\n which doesn't have any effect on the actual app, but is enough to trigger a screenshot. It has no effect to the application and is not something you would do in your tests. The goal was to find \nsome\n event that a user would never trigger, so that we know it's from \nsnapshot\n. On tvOS, there is no orientation so we ask for a count of app views with type \"Browser\" (which should never exist on tvOS).\n\n\nsnapshot\n then iterates through all test events and check where we either did this weird rotation (on iOS) or searched for browsers (on tvOS). Once \nsnapshot\n has all events triggered by \nsnapshot\n it collects a ordered list of all the file names of the actual screenshots of the application.\n\n\nIn the test output, the Swift \nsnapshot\n function will print out something like this\n\n\n\n\nsnapshot: [some random text here]\n\n\n\n\nsnapshot\n finds all these entries using a regex. The number of \nsnapshot\n outputs in the terminal and the number of \nsnapshot\n events in the plist file should be the same. Knowing that, \nsnapshot\n automatically matches these 2 lists to identify the name of each of these screenshots. They are then copied over to the output directory and separated by language and device.\n\n\n2 thing have to be passed on from \nsnapshot\n to the \nxcodebuild\n command line tool:\n\n\n\n\nThe device type is passed via the \ndestination\n parameter of the \nxcodebuild\n parameter\n\n\nThe language is passed via a temporary file which is written by \nsnapshot\n before running the tests and read by the UI Tests when launching the application\n\n\n\n\nIf you find a better way to do any of this, please submit an issue on GitHub or even a pull request :+1:\n\n\nRadar \n23062925\n has been resolved with Xcode 8.3, so it's now possible to actually take screenshots from the simulator. We'll keep using the old approach for now, since many of you still want to use older versions of Xcode.\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\n\n  Check out the new \nfastlane documentation\n on how to generate screenshots\n\n\n\n\n\nFrame the screenshots\n\n\nIf you want to add frames around the screenshots and even put a title on top, check out \nframeit\n.\n\n\nAvailable language codes\n\n\nALL_LANGUAGES = [\nda\n, \nde-DE\n, \nel\n, \nen-AU\n, \nen-CA\n, \nen-GB\n, \nen-US\n, \nes-ES\n, \nes-MX\n, \nfi\n, \nfr-CA\n, \nfr-FR\n, \nid\n, \nit\n, \nja\n, \nko\n, \nms\n, \nnl-NL\n, \nno\n, \npt-BR\n, \npt-PT\n, \nru\n, \nsv\n, \nth\n, \ntr\n, \nvi\n, \nzh-Hans\n, \nzh-Hant\n]\n\n\n\n\nTo get more information about language and locale codes please read \nInternationalization and Localization Guide\n.\n\n\nUse a clean status bar\n\n\nYou can use \nSimulatorStatusMagic\n to clean up the status bar.\n\n\nEditing the \nSnapfile\n\n\nChange syntax highlighting to \nRuby\n.\n\n\nSimulator doesn't launch the application\n\n\nWhen the app dies directly after the application is launched there might be 2 problems\n\n\n\n\nThe simulator is somehow in a broken state and you need to re-create it.

This is the default behavior in order to take your screenshots as quickly as possible. This can be disabled to run each device, one at a time, by setting the  :concurrent_simulators  option to  false .  Note:  While running  snapshot  with Xcode 9, the simulators will not be visibly spawned. So, while you wont see the simulators running your tests, they will, in fact, be taking your screenshots.  If any error occurs while running the snapshot script on a device, that device will not have any screenshots, and  snapshot  will continue with the next device or language. To stop the flow after the first error, run  fastlane snapshot --stop_after_first_error  Also by default,  snapshot  will open the HTML after all is done. This can be skipped with the following command  fastlane snapshot --stop_after_first_error --skip_open_summary  There are a lot of options available that define how to build your app, for example  fastlane snapshot --scheme  UITests  --configuration  Release   --sdk  iphonesimulator   Reinstall the app before running  snapshot  fastlane snapshot --reinstall_app --app_identifier  tools.fastlane.app   By default  snapshot  automatically retries running UI Tests if they fail. This is due to randomly failing UI Tests (e.g.  #2517 ). You can adapt this number using  fastlane snapshot --number_of_retries 3  Add photos and/or videos to the simulator before running  snapshot  fastlane snapshot --add_photos MyTestApp/Assets/demo.jpg --add_videos MyTestApp/Assets/demo.mp4  For a list for all available options run  fastlane action snapshot  After running  snapshot  you will get a nice summary:",

            "text": "The easiest solution would be to just render the UIWindow into a file. That's not possible because UI Tests don't run on a main thread. So  snapshot  uses a different approach:  When you run unit tests in Xcode, the reporter generates a plist file, documenting all events that occurred during the tests ( More Information ). Additionally, Xcode generates screenshots before, during and after each of these events. There is no way to manually trigger a screenshot event. The screenshots and the plist files are stored in the DerivedData directory, which  snapshot  stores in a temporary folder.  When the user calls  snapshot(...)  in the UI Tests (Swift or Objective C) the script actually does a rotation to  .Unknown  which doesn't have any effect on the actual app, but is enough to trigger a screenshot. It has no effect to the application and is not something you would do in your tests. The goal was to find  some  event that a user would never trigger, so that we know it's from  snapshot . On tvOS, there is no orientation so we ask for a count of app views with type \"Browser\" (which should never exist on tvOS).  snapshot  then iterates through all test events and check where we either did this weird rotation (on iOS) or searched for browsers (on tvOS). Once  snapshot  has all events triggered by  snapshot  it collects a ordered list of all the file names of the actual screenshots of the application.  In the test output, the Swift  snapshot  function will print out something like this   snapshot: [some random text here]   snapshot  finds all these entries using a regex. The number of  snapshot  outputs in the terminal and the number of  snapshot  events in the plist file should be the same. Knowing that,  snapshot  automatically matches these 2 lists to identify the name of each of these screenshots.

values\n\n\nDeliver has a special \ndefault\n language code which allows you to provide values that are not localized, and which will be used as defaults when you don\u2019t provide a specific localized value.\n\n\nIn order to use \ndefault\n, you will need to tell \ndeliver\n which languages your app uses. You can do this in either of two ways:\n1. Create the folders named with the language in the metadata folder (i.e. fastlane/metadata/en-US or fastlane/metadata/de-DE)\n2. Add the following to your \nDeliverfile\n \nlanguages(['en-US','de-DE'])\n\n\nYou can use this either in json within your \nDeliverfile\n and/or as folders in your metadata folder. \ndeliver\n will take the union of both language sets from the \nDeliverfile\n and from the metadata folder and create on single set of languages which will be enabled.\n\n\nImagine that you have localized data for the following language codes:  \nen-US, de-DE, el, it\n\n\nYou can set the following in your \nDeliverfile\n\n\nrelease_notes({\n  'default' =\n \nShiny and new\n,\n  'de-DE' =\n \nglaenzend und neu\n\n})\n\n\n\n\nDeliver will use \"Shiny and new\" for en-US, el and it.\n\n\nIt will use \"glaenzend und neu\" for de-DE.\n\n\nYou can do the same with folders\n\n\n   default\n      keywords.txt\n      marketing_url.txt\n      name.txt\n      privacy_url.txt\n      support_url.txt\n      release_notes.txt\n   en-US\n      description.txt\n   de-DE\n      description.txt\n   el\n      description.txt\n   it\n      description.txt\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, default values for keywords, urls, name and release notes are used in all localizations, but each language has a fully localized description\n\n\nAutomatically create screenshots\n\n\nIf you want to integrate \ndeliver\n with \nsnapshot\n, check out \nfastlane\n!\n\n\nJenkins integration\n\n\nDetailed instructions about how to set up \ndeliver\n and \nfastlane\n in \nJenkins\n can be found in the \nfastlane README\n.\n\n\nFirewall Issues\n\n\ndeliver\n uses the iTunes Transporter to upload metadata and binaries. In case you are behind a firewall, you can specify a different transporter protocol using\n\n\nDELIVER_ITMSTRANSPORTER_ADDITIONAL_UPLOAD_PARAMETERS=\n-t DAV\n fastlane deliver\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Proxy\n\n\niTunes Transporter is a Java application bundled with Xcode. In addition to utilizing the \nDELIVER_ITMSTRANSPORTER_ADDITIONAL_UPLOAD_PARAMETERS=\"-t DAV\"\n, you need to configure the transporter application to use the proxy independently from the system proxy or any environment proxy settings. You can find the configuration file within Xcode:\n\n\nTOOLS_PATH=$( xcode-select -p )\nREL_PATH='../Applications/Application Loader.app/Contents/itms/java/lib/net.properties'\necho \n$TOOLS_PATH/$REL_PATH\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd necessary proxy configuration values to the net.properties according to \nJava Proxy Configuration\n.\n\n\nAs an alternative to editing the properties files, proxy configuration can be specified on the command line directly:\n\n\nDELIVER_ITMSTRANSPORTER_ADDITIONAL_UPLOAD_PARAMETERS=\n-t DAV -Dhttp.proxyHost=myproxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080\n\n\n\n\n\nLimit\n\n\niTunes Connect has a limit of 150 binary uploads per day.\n\n\nEditing the \nDeliverfile\n\n\nChange syntax highlighting to \nRuby\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeliver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\n\nios, mac\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n@KrauseFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Examples\n\n\nupload_to_app_store(\n  force: true, # Set to true to skip PDF verification\n  itc_provider: \nabcde12345\n # pass a specific value to the iTMSTransporter -itc_provider option\n)\n\n\n\n\ndeliver   # alias for \nupload_to_app_store\n\n\n\n\n\nappstore  # alias for \nupload_to_app_store\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusername\n\n\nYour Apple ID Username\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp_identifier\n\n\nThe bundle identifier of your app\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp\n\n\nThe app ID of the app you want to use/modify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedit_live\n\n\nModify live metadata, this option disables ipa upload and screenshot upload\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nipa\n\n\nPath to your ipa file\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg\n\n\nPath to your pkg file\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplatform\n\n\nThe platform to use (optional)\n\n\nios\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata_path\n\n\nPath to the folder containing the metadata files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscreenshots_path\n\n\nPath to the folder containing the screenshots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_binary_upload\n\n\nSkip uploading an ipa or pkg to iTunes Connect\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse_live_version\n\n\nForce usage of live version rather than edit version\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_screenshots\n\n\nDon't upload the screenshots\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp_version\n\n\nThe version that should be edited or created\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_metadata\n\n\nDon't upload the metadata (e.g. title, description).

Create the folders named with the language in the metadata folder (i.e. fastlane/metadata/en-US or fastlane/metadata/de-DE)\n2. Add the following to your  Deliverfile   languages(['en-US','de-DE'])  You can use this either in json within your  Deliverfile  and/or as folders in your metadata folder.  deliver  will take the union of both language sets from the  Deliverfile  and from the metadata folder and create on single set of languages which will be enabled.  Imagine that you have localized data for the following language codes:   en-US, de-DE, el, it  You can set the following in your  Deliverfile  release_notes({\n  'default' =   Shiny and new ,\n  'de-DE' =   glaenzend und neu \n})  Deliver will use \"Shiny and new\" for en-US, el and it.

Originally the frames are coming from \nFacebook frameset\n and they are kept on \nthis repo\n.\n\n\nMore information about this process and how to update the frames can be found \nhere\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nWhy should you have to use Photoshop, just to add a frame around your screenshots?\n\n\nJust navigate to your folder of screenshots and use the following command:\n\n\nfastlane frameit\n\n\n\nTo use the silver version of the frames:\n\n\nfastlane frameit silver\n\n\n\nTo download the latest frames\n\n\nfastlane frameit download_frames\n\n\n\nWhen using \nframeit\n without titles on top, the screenshots will have the full resolution, which means they can't be uploaded to the App Store directly. They are supposed to be used for websites, print media and emails. Check out the section below to use the screenshots for the App Store.\n\n\nTitles and Background (optional)\n\n\nWith \nframeit\n 2.0 you are now able to add a custom background, title and text colors to your screenshots.\n\n\nA working example can be found in the \nfastlane examples\n project.\n\n\nFramefile.json\n\n\nUse it to define the general information:\n\n\n{\n  \ndevice_frame_version\n: \nlatest\n,\n  \ndefault\n: {\n    \nkeyword\n: {\n      \nfont\n: \n./fonts/MyFont-Rg.otf\n\n    },\n    \ntitle\n: {\n      \nfont\n: \n./fonts/MyFont-Th.otf\n,\n      \ncolor\n: \n#545454\n\n    },\n    \nbackground\n: \n./background.jpg\n,\n    \npadding\n: 50,\n    \nshow_complete_frame\n: false,\n    \nstack_title\n : false,\n    \ntitle_below_image\n: true\n  },\n\n  \ndata\n: [\n    {\n      \nfilter\n: \nBrainstorming\n,\n      \nkeyword\n: {\n        \ncolor\n: \n#d21559\n\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \nfilter\n: \nOrganizing\n,\n      \nkeyword\n: {\n        \ncolor\n: \n#feb909\n\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \nfilter\n: \nSharing\n,\n      \nkeyword\n: {\n        \ncolor\n: \n#aa4dbc\n\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \nfilter\n: \nStyling\n,\n      \nkeyword\n: {\n        \ncolor\n: \n#31bb48\n\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nstack_title\n value specifies whether \nframeit\n should display the keyword above the title when both keyword and title are defined.\n\n\nThe \nshow_complete_frame\n value specifies whether \nframeit\n should shrink the device and frame so that they show in full in the framed screenshot. If it is false, then they can hang over the bottom of the screenshot.\n\n\nThe \ntitle_below_image\n value specifies whether \nframeit\n should place the title below the screenshot. If it is false, it will be placed above the screenshot.\n\n\nThe \nfilter\n value is a part of the screenshot named for which the given option should be used. If a screenshot is named \niPhone5_Brainstorming.png\n the first entry in the \ndata\n array will be used.\n\n\nYou can find a more complex \nconfiguration\n to also support Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages.\n\n\nThe \nFramefile.json\n should be in the \nscreenshots\n folder, as seen in the \nexample\n.\n\n\n.strings\n files\n\n\nTo define the title and optionally the keyword, put two \n.strings\n files into the language folder (e.g. \nen-US in the example project\n)\n\n\nThe \nkeyword.strings\n and \ntitle.strings\n are standard \n.strings\n file you already use for your iOS apps, making it easy to use your existing translation service to get localized titles.\n\n\nNote:\n These \n.strings\n files \nMUST\n be utf-16 encoded (UTF-16 BE with BOM).  They also must begin with an empty line. If you are having trouble see \nissue #1740\n\n\nNote:\n You \nMUST\n provide a background if you want titles. \nframeit\n will not add the tiles if a background is not specified.\n\n\nUploading screenshots to iTC\n\n\nUse \ndeliver\n to upload all screenshots to iTunes Connect completely automatically \ud83d\ude80\n\n\nMac\n\n\nWith \nframeit\n 2.0 it's possible to also frame macOS Application screenshots. You have to provide the following:\n\n\n\n\nThe \noffset\n information so \nframeit\n knows where to put your screenshots\n\n\nA path to a \nbackground\n, which should contain both the background and the Mac\n\n\ntitleHeight\n: The height in px that should be used for the title\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n{\n  \ndefault\n: {\n    \ntitle\n: {\n      \ncolor\n: \n#545454\n\n    },\n    \nbackground\n: \nMac.jpg\n,\n    \noffset\n: {\n      \noffset\n: \n+676+479\n,\n      \ntitleHeight\n: 320\n    }\n  },\n  \ndata\n: [\n    {\n      \nfilter\n: \nBrainstorming\n,\n      \nkeyword\n: {\n        \ncolor\n: \n#d21559\n\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the \nMindNode example project\n.\n\n\nTips\n\n\nGenerate localized screenshots\n\n\nCheck out \nsnapshot\n to automatically generate screenshots using \nUI Automation\n.\n\n\nAlternative location to store device_frames\n\n\nDevice frames can also be stored in a \n./fastlane/screenshots/devices_frames\n directory if you prefer rather than in the \n~/.frameit/device_frames\n directory. If doing so please be aware that Apple's images are copyrighted and should not be redistributed as part of a repository so you may want to include them in your .gitignore file.\n\n\nWhite background of frames\n\n\nSome stock images provided by Apple still have a white background instead of a transparent one. You'll have to edit the Photoshop file to remove the white background, delete the generated \n.png\n file and run \nfastlane frameit\n again.\n\n\nUse a clean status bar\n\n\nYou can use \nSimulatorStatusMagic\n to clean up the status bar.\n\n\nGray artifacts around text\n\n\nIf you run into any quality issues, like having a border around the font, it usually helps to just re-install \nimagemagick\n. You can do so by running\n\n\nbrew uninstall imagemagick\nbrew install imagemagick\n\n\n\n\nUninstall\n\n\n\n\nsudo gem uninstall fastlane\n\n\nrm -rf ~/.frameit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nframe_screenshots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\n\nios, mac\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n@KrauseFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Examples\n\n\nframe_screenshots\n\n\n\n\nframeit # alias for \nframe_screenshots\n\n\n\n\n\nframe_screenshots(silver: true)\n\n\n\n\nframe_screenshots(path: \n/screenshots\n)\n\n\n\n\nframe_screenshots(rose_gold: true)\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhite\n\n\nUse white device frames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsilver\n\n\nUse white device frames.

This does the following:   Create a new signing request  Create a new push certification  Downloads the certificate  Generates a new  .pem  file in the current working directory, which you can upload to your server   Note that  _pem_  will never revoke your existing certificates.  pem  can't download any of your existing push certificates, as the private key is only available on the machine it was created on.   If you already have a push certificate enabled, which is active for at least 30 more days,  pem  will not create a new certificate. If you still want to create one, use the  force :  fastlane pem --force  You can pass parameters like this:  fastlane pem -a com.krausefx.app -u username  If you want to generate a development certificate instead:  fastlane pem --development  Set a password for your  p12  file:  fastlane pem -p \"MyPass\"  You can specify a name for the output file:  fastlane pem -o my.pem  To get a list of available options run:  fastlane action pem",

If you want more control, here are some available parameters:\n\n\nfastlane gym --workspace \nExample.xcworkspace\n --scheme \nAppName\n --clean\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to use a different Xcode installation, use \nxcode-select\n or define \nDEVELOPER_DIR\n:\n\n\nDEVELOPER_DIR=\n/Applications/Xcode6.2.app\n fastlane gym\n\n\n\n\nFor a list of all available parameters use\n\n\nfastlane action gym\n\n\n\n\nIf you run into any issues, use the \nverbose\n mode to get more information\n\n\nfastlane gym --verbose\n\n\n\n\nSet the right export method if you're not uploading to App Store or TestFlight:\n\n\nfastlane gym --export_method ad-hoc\n\n\n\n\nTo pass boolean parameters make sure to use \ngym\n like this:\n\n\nfastlane gym --include_bitcode true --include_symbols false\n\n\n\n\nTo access the raw \nxcodebuild\n output open \n~/Library/Logs/gym\n\n\nGymfile\n\n\nSince you might want to manually trigger a new build but don't want to specify all the parameters every time, you can store your defaults in a so called \nGymfile\n.\n\n\nRun \nfastlane gym init\n to create a new configuration file.

By default \ngym\n creates this file for you and you are able to modify some parameters by using \nexport_method\n, \nexport_team_id\n, \ninclude_symbols\n or \ninclude_bitcode\n. If you want to have more options, like creating manifest file for app thinning, you can provide your own \nplist\n file:\n\n\nexport_options(\n./ExportOptions.plist\n)\n\n\n\n\nor you can provide hash of values directly in the \nGymfile\n:\n\n\nexport_options(\n  method: \nad-hoc\n,\n  manifest: {\n    appURL: \nhttps://example.com/My App.ipa\n,\n  },\n  thinning: \nthin-for-all-variants\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nOptional: If \ngym\n can't automatically detect the provisioning profiles to use, you can pass a mapping of bundle identifiers to provisioning profiles:\n\n\nexport_options(\n  method: \napp-store\n,\n  provisioningProfiles: { \n    \ncom.example.bundleid\n =\n \nProvisioning Profile Name\n,\n    \ncom.example.bundleid2\n =\n \nProvisioning Profile Name 2\n\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: If you use \nfastlane\n with \nmatch\n you don't need to provide those values manually.\n\n\nFor the list of available options run \nxcodebuild -help\n.\n\n\nSetup code signing\n\n\n\n\nMore information on how to get started with codesigning\n\n\nDocs on how to set up your Xcode project\n\n\n\n\nAutomating the whole process\n\n\ngym\n works great together with \nfastlane\n, which connects all deployment tools into one streamlined workflow.\n\n\nUsing \nfastlane\n you can define a configuration like\n\n\nlane :beta do\n  scan\n  gym(scheme: \nMyApp\n)\n  crashlytics\nend\n\n# error block is executed when a error occurs\nerror do |lane, exception|\n  slack(\n    # message with short human friendly message\n    message: exception.to_s, \n    success: false, \n    # Output containing extended log output\n    payload: { \nOutput\n =\n exception.error_info.to_s } \n  )\nend\n\n\n\n\nWhen \ngym\n raises an error the \nerror_info\n property will contain the process output\nin case you want to display the error in 3rd party tools such as Slack.\n\n\nYou can then easily switch between the beta provider (e.g. \ntestflight\n, \nhockey\n, \ns3\n and more).\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\ngym\n uses the latest APIs to build and sign your application. The 2 main components are\n\n\n\n\nxcodebuild\n\n\nxcpretty\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run \ngym\n without the \n--silent\n mode it will print out every command it executes.\n\n\nTo build the archive \ngym\n uses the following command:\n\n\nset -o pipefail \n \\\nxcodebuild -scheme 'Example' \\\n-project './Example.xcodeproj' \\\n-configuration 'Release' \\\n-destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \\\n-archivePath '/Users/felixkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-08-11/ExampleProductName 2015-08-11 18.15.30.xcarchive' \\\narchive | xcpretty\n\n\n\n\nAfter building the archive it is being checked by \ngym\n. If it's valid, it gets packaged up and signed into an \nipa\n file.\n\n\ngym\n automatically chooses a different packaging method depending on the version of Xcode you're using.\n\n\nXcode 7 and above\n\n\n/usr/bin/xcrun path/to/xcbuild-safe.sh -exportArchive \\\n-exportOptionsPlist '/tmp/gym_config_1442852529.plist' \\\n-archivePath '/Users/fkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-09-21/App 2015-09-21 09.21.56.xcarchive' \\\n-exportPath '/tmp/1442852529'\n\n\n\n\ngym\n makes use of the new Xcode 7 API which allows us to specify the export options using a \nplist\n file.

You can also use \nforce: true\n to re-generate the provisioning profile on each run.\n\n\nImportant:\n The \nforce_for_new_devices\n parameter is ignored for App Store provisioning profiles since they don't contain any device information.\n\n\nIf you're not using \nfastlane\n, you can also use the \nforce_for_new_devices\n option from the command line:\n\n\nfastlane match adhoc --force_for_new_devices\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Targets\n\n\nIf your app has multiple targets (e.g. Today Widget or WatchOS Extension)\n\n\nmatch(app_identifier: [\ntools.fastlane.app\n, \ntools.fastlane.app.today_widget\n], type: \nappstore\n)\n\n\n\n\nmatch\n can even use the same one Git repository for all bundle identifiers.\n\n\nTemplates (aka: custom entitlements)\n\n\nMatch can generate profiles that contain custom entitlements by passing in the entitlement's name with the \ntemplate_name\n parameter.\n\n\nmatch(git_url: \nhttps://github.com/fastlane/certificates\n,\n      type: \ndevelopment\n,\n      template_name: \nApple Pay Pass Suppression Development\n)\n\n\n\n\nSetup Xcode project\n\n\nDocs on how to set up your Xcode project\n\n\nTo build from the command line using \nfastlane\n\n\nmatch\n automatically pre-fills environment variables with the UUIDs of the correct provisioning profiles, ready to be used in your Xcode project.\n\n\nMore information about how to setup your Xcode project can be found \nhere\n\n\nTo build from Xcode manually\n\n\nThis is useful when installing your application on your device using the Development profile.\n\n\nYou can statically select the right provisioning profile in your Xcode project (the name will be \nmatch Development tools.fastlane.app\n).\n\n\nDocs on how to set up your Xcode project\n\n\nContinuous Integration\n\n\nRepo access\n\n\nThere is one tricky part of setting up a CI system to work with \nmatch\n, which is enabling the CI to access the repo. Usually you'd just add your CI's public ssh key as a deploy key to your \nmatch\n repo, but since your CI will already likely be using its public ssh key to access the codebase repo, \nyou won't be able to do that\n.\n\n\nSome repo hosts might allow you to use the same deploy key for different repos, but GitHub will not. If your host does, you don't need to worry about this, just add your CI's public ssh key as a deploy key for your \nmatch\n repo and scroll down to \"\nEncryption password\n\".\n\n\nThere are a few ways around this:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new account on your repo host with read-only access to your \nmatch\n repo. Bitrise have a good description of this \nhere\n.\n\n\nSome CIs allow you to upload your signing credentials manually, but obviously this means that you'll have to re-upload the profiles/keys/certs each time they change.\n\n\n\n\nNeither solution is pretty. It's one of those \ntrade-off\n things. Do you care more about \nnot\n having an extra account sitting around, or do you care more about having the :sparkles: of auto-syncing of credentials.\n\n\nEncryption password\n\n\nOnce you've decided which approach to take, all that's left to do is to set your encryption password as secret environment variable named \nMATCH_PASSWORD\n. \nmatch\n will pick this up when it's run.\n\n\nNuke\n\n\nIf you never really cared about code signing and have a messy Apple Developer account with a lot of invalid, expired or Xcode managed profiles/certificates, you can use the \nmatch nuke\n command to revoke your certificates and provisioning profiles. Don't worry, apps that are already available in the App Store / TestFlight will still work. Builds distributed via Ad Hoc or Enterprise will be disabled after nuking your account, so you'll have to re-upload a new build. After clearing your account you'll start from a clean state, and you can run \nmatch\n to generate your certificates and profiles again.\n\n\nTo revoke all certificates and provisioning profiles for a specific environment:\n\n\nfastlane match nuke development\nfastlane match nuke distribution\nfastlane match nuke enterprise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll have to confirm a list of profiles / certificates that will be deleted.\n\n\nChange Password\n\n\nTo change the password of your repo and therefore decrypting and encrypting all files run\n\n\nfastlane match change_password\n\n\n\n\nYou'll be asked for the new password on all your machines on the next run.\n\n\nManual Decrypt\n\n\nIf you want to manually decrypt a file you can.\n\n\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -k \npassword\n -in \nfileYouWantToDecryptPath\n -out \ndecryptedFilePath\n -a -d\n\n\n\n\nIs this secure?\n\n\nBoth your keys and provisioning profiles are encrypted using OpenSSL using a passphrase.\n\n\nStoring your private keys in a Git repo may sound off-putting at first. We did an in-depth analysis of potential security issues and came to the following conclusions:\n\n\nWhat could happen if someone stole a private key?\n\n\nIf attackers would have your certificate and provisioning profile, they could codesign an application with the same bundle identifier.\n\n\nWhat's the worst that could happen for each of the profile types?\n\n\nApp Store Profiles\n\n\nAn App Store profile can't be used for anything as long as it's not re-signed by Apple. The only way to get an app resigned is to submit an app for review which could take anywhere from 24 hours to a few days (checkout \nappreviewtimes.com\n for up-to-date expectations). Attackers could only submit an app for review, if they also got access to your iTunes Connect credentials (which are not stored in git, but in your local keychain). Additionally you get an email notification every time a build gets uploaded to cancel the submission even before your app gets into the review stage.\n\n\nDevelopment and Ad Hoc Profiles\n\n\nIn general those profiles are harmless as they can only be used to install a signed application on a small subset of devices. To add new devices, the attacker would also need your Apple Developer Portal credentials (which are not stored in git, but in your local keychain).\n\n\nEnterprise Profiles\n\n\nAttackers could use an In-House profile to distribute signed application to a potentially unlimited number of devices. All this would run under your company name and it could eventually lead to Apple revoking your In-House account. However it is very easy to revoke a certificate to remotely break the app on all devices.\n\n\nBecause of the potentially dangerous nature of In-House profiles please use \nmatch\n with enterprise profiles with caution, ensure your git repository is private and use a secure password.\n\n\nTo sum up\n\n\n\n\nYou have full control over the access list of your Git repo, no third party service involved\n\n\nEven if your certificates are leaked, they can't be used to cause any harm without your iTunes Connect login credentials\n\n\nUse In-House enterprise profile with \nmatch\n with caution\n\n\nIf you use GitHub or Bitbucket we encourage enabling 2 factor authentication for all accounts that have access to the certificates repo\n\n\nThe complete source code of \nmatch\n is fully open source on \nGitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\n\nios\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n@KrauseFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Examples\n\n\nsync_code_signing(type: \nappstore\n, app_identifier: \ntools.fastlane.app\n)\n\n\n\n\nsync_code_signing(type: \ndevelopment\n, readonly: true)\n\n\n\n\nsync_code_signing(app_identifier: [\ntools.fastlane.app\n, \ntools.fastlane.sleepy\n])\n\n\n\n\nmatch   # alias for \nsync_code_signing\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit_url\n\n\nURL to the git repo containing all the certificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit_branch\n\n\nSpecific git branch to use\n\n\nmaster\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\nDefine the profile type, can be appstore, adhoc, development, enterprise\n\n\ndevelopment\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp_identifier\n\n\nThe bundle identifier(s) of your app (comma-separated)\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusername\n\n\nYour Apple ID Username\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkeychain_name\n\n\nKeychain the items should be imported to\n\n\nlogin.keychain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkeychain_password\n\n\nThis might be required the first time you access certificates on a new mac.

scan\n\n\n\n\nWhy \nscan\n?\n\n\nscan\n uses the latest APIs and tools to make running tests plain simple and offer a great integration into your existing workflow, like \nfastlane\n or Jenkins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscan Features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfc1\n\n\nBeautiful inline build output while running the tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea0\n\n\nSensible defaults: Automatically

To generate the nice output, \nscan\n uses \nxcpretty\n. You can alway access the raw output in \n~/Library/Logs/scan\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nfastlane scan\n\n\n\nThat's all you need to run your tests. If you want more control, here are some available parameters:\n\n\nfastlane scan --workspace \"Example.xcworkspace\" --scheme \"AppName\" --device \"iPhone 6\" --clean\n\n\n\nIf you need to use a different xcode install, use \nxcode-select\n or define \nDEVELOPER_DIR\n:\n\n\nDEVELOPER_DIR=\"/Applications/Xcode6.2.app\" scan\n\n\n\nTo run \nscan\n on multiple devices via \nfastlane\n, add this to your \nFastfile\n:\n\n\nscan(\n  workspace: \nExample.xcworkspace\n,\n  devices: [\niPhone 6s\n, \niPad Air\n]\n)\n\n\n\n\nFor a list of all available parameters use\n\n\nfastlane action scan\n\n\n\n\nTo access the raw \nxcodebuild\n output open \n~/Library/Logs/scan\n\n\nScanfile\n\n\nSince you might want to manually trigger the tests but don't want to specify all the parameters every time, you can store your defaults in a so called \nScanfile\n.\n\n\nRun \nfastlane scan init\n to create a new configuration file. Example:\n\n\nscheme(\nExample\n)\ndevices([\niPhone 6s\n, \niPad Air\n])\n\nclean(true)\n\noutput_types(\nhtml\n)\n\n\n\n\nAutomating the whole process\n\n\nscan\n works great together with \nfastlane\n, which connects all deployment tools into one streamlined workflow.\n\n\nUsing \nfastlane\n you can define a configuration like\n\n\nlane :test do\n  scan(scheme: \nExample\n)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrun_tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\n\nios, mac\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n@KrauseFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Examples\n\n\nrun_tests\n\n\n\n\nscan # alias for \nrun_tests\n\n\n\n\n\nrun_tests(\n  workspace: \nApp.xcworkspace\n,\n  scheme: \nMyTests\n,\n  clean: false\n)\n\n\n\n\n# Build For Testing\nrun_tests(\n   derived_data_path: \nmy_folder\n,\n   build_for_testing: true\n)\n\n\n\n\n# run tests using derived data from prev. build\nrun_tests(\n   derived_data_path: \nmy_folder\n,\n   test_without_building: true\n)\n\n\n\n\n# or run it from an existing xctestrun package\nrun_tests(\n   xctestrun: \n/path/to/mytests.xctestrun\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nworkspace\n\n\nPath to the workspace file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nproject\n\n\nPath to the project file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevice\n\n\nThe name of the simulator type you want to run tests on (e.g. 'iPhone 6')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoolchain\n\n\nThe toolchain that should be used for building the application (e.g. com.apple.dt.toolchain.Swift_2_3, org.swift.30p620160816a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevices\n\n\nArray of devices to run the tests on (e.g. ['iPhone 6', 'iPad Air'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscheme\n\n\nThe project's scheme.

scan\n\n\n\n\nWhy \nscan\n?\n\n\nscan\n uses the latest APIs and tools to make running tests plain simple and offer a great integration into your existing workflow, like \nfastlane\n or Jenkins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscan Features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfc1\n\n\nBeautiful inline build output while running the tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udea0\n\n\nSensible defaults: Automatically detect the project, schemes and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcca\n\n\nSupport for HTML, JSON and JUnit reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd0e\n\n\nXcode duplicated your simulators again? \nscan\n will handle this for you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17\n\n\nWorks perfectly with \nfastlane\n and other tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude85\n\n\nDon't remember any complicated build commands, just \nscan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd27\n\n\nEasy and dynamic configuration using parameters and environment variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udce2\n\n\nBeautiful slack notifications of the test results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcbe\n\n\nStore common build settings in a \nScanfile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udce4\n\n\nThe raw \nxcodebuild\n outputs are stored in \n~/Library/Logs/scan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcbb\n\n\nSupports both iOS and Mac applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc71\n\n\nAutomatically switches to the \ntravis formatter\n when running on Travis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcd6\n\n\nHelps you resolve common test errors like simulator not responding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscan\n uses a plain \nxcodebuild\n command, therefore keeping 100% compatible with \nxcodebuild\n. To generate the nice output, \nscan\n uses \nxcpretty\n.

We will not go into detail on how to write scripts.\n\n\nHere a few links to get started:\n\n\n\n\nWWDC 2015 Introduction to UI Tests\n\n\nA first look into UI Tests\n\n\nUI Testing in Xcode 7\n\n\nHSTestingBackchannel : \u2018Cheat\u2019 by communicating directly with your app\n\n\nAutomating App Store screenshots using fastlane snapshot and frameit\n\n\n\n\nQuick Start\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new UI Test target in your Xcode project (\ntop part of this article\n)\n\n\nRun \nfastlane snapshot init\n in your project folder\n\n\nAdd the ./SnapshotHelper.swift to your UI Test target (You can move the file anywhere you want)\n\n\n(Xcode 8 only) add the ./SnapshotHelperXcode8.swift to your UI Test target\n\n\n(Objective C only) add the bridging header to your test class:\n\n\n#import \"MYUITests-Swift.h\"\n\n    (The bridging header is named after your test target with \n-Swift.h\n appended.)\n\n\nIn your UI Test class, click the \nRecord\n button on the bottom left and record your interaction\n\n\nTo take a snapshot, call the following between interactions\n\n\nSwift: \nsnapshot(\"01LoginScreen\")\n\n\nObjective C: \n[Snapshot snapshot:@\"01LoginScreen\" timeWaitingForIdle:10];\n\n\nAdd the following code to your \nsetUp()\n method:\n\n\nSwift:\n    \nswift\n    let app = XCUIApplication()\n    setupSnapshot(app)\n    app.launch()\n\n\nObjective C:\n\n\nobjective-c\n    XCUIApplication *app = [[XCUIApplication alloc] init];\n    [Snapshot setupSnapshot:app];\n    [app launch];\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you only have one \nlaunch\n call in your test class, as Xcode adds one automatically on new test files.\n\n\n\n\nYou can try the \nsnapshot\n \nexample project\n by cloning this repo.\n\n\nTo quick start your UI tests, you can use the UI Test recorder. You only have to interact with the simulator, and Xcode will generate the UI Test code for you. You can find the red record button on the bottom of the screen (more information in \nthis blog post\n)\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nfastlane snapshot\n\n\n\n\nYour screenshots will be stored in the \n./screenshots/\n folder by default (or \n./fastlane/screenshots\n if you're using \nfastlane\n)\n\n\nNew with Xcode 9, \nsnapshot\n can run multiple simulators concurrently. This is the default behavior in order to take your screenshots as quickly as possible. This can be disabled to run each device, one at a time, by setting the \n:concurrent_simulators\n option to \nfalse\n.\n\n\nNote:\n While running \nsnapshot\n with Xcode 9, the simulators will not be visibly spawned. So, while you wont see the simulators running your tests, they will, in fact, be taking your screenshots.\n\n\nIf any error occurs while running the snapshot script on a device, that device will not have any screenshots, and \nsnapshot\n will continue with the next device or language. To stop the flow after the first error, run\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --stop_after_first_error\n\n\n\n\nAlso by default, \nsnapshot\n will open the HTML after all is done. This can be skipped with the following command\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --stop_after_first_error --skip_open_summary\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of options available that define how to build your app, for example\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --scheme \nUITests\n --configuration \nRelease\n  --sdk \niphonesimulator\n\n\n\n\n\nReinstall the app before running \nsnapshot\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --reinstall_app --app_identifier \ntools.fastlane.app\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default \nsnapshot\n automatically retries running UI Tests if they fail. This is due to randomly failing UI Tests (e.g. \n#2517\n). You can adapt this number using\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --number_of_retries 3\n\n\n\n\nAdd photos and/or videos to the simulator before running \nsnapshot\n\n\nfastlane snapshot --add_photos MyTestApp/Assets/demo.jpg --add_videos MyTestApp/Assets/demo.mp4\n\n\n\n\nFor a list for all available options run\n\n\nfastlane action snapshot\n\n\n\n\nAfter running \nsnapshot\n you will get a nice summary:\n\n\n\n\nSnapfile\n\n\nAll of the available options can also be stored in a configuration file called the \nSnapfile\n. Since most values will not change often for your project, it is recommended to store them there:\n\n\nFirst make sure to have a \nSnapfile\n (you get it for free when running \nfastlane snapshot init\n)\n\n\nThe \nSnapfile\n can contain all the options that are also available on \nfastlane action snapshot\n\n\nscheme(\nUITests\n)\n\ndevices([\n  \niPhone 6\n,\n  \niPhone 6 Plus\n,\n  \niPhone 5\n,\n  \niPhone 4s\n\n])\n\nlanguages([\n  \nen-US\n,\n  \nde-DE\n,\n  \nes-ES\n,\n  [\npt\n, \npt_BR\n] # Portuguese with Brazilian locale\n])\n\nlaunch_arguments([\n-username Felix\n])\n\n# The directory in which the screenshots should be stored\noutput_directory('./screenshots')\n\nclear_previous_screenshots(true)\n\nadd_photos([\nMyTestApp/Assets/demo.jpg\n])\n\n\n\n\nCompletely reset all simulators\n\n\nYou can run this command in the terminal to delete and re-create all iOS and tvOS simulators:\n\n\nfastlane snapshot reset_simulators\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n: This will delete \nall\n your simulators and replace by new ones! This is useful, if you run into weird problems when running \nsnapshot\n.\n\n\nYou can use the environment variable \nSNAPSHOT_FORCE_DELETE\n to stop asking for confirmation before deleting.\n\n\nSNAPSHOT_FORCE_DELETE=1 fastlane snapshot reset_simulators\n\n\n\n\nUpdate snapshot helpers\n\n\nSome updates require the helper files to be updated. \nsnapshot\n will automatically warn you and tell you how to update.\n\n\nBasically you can run\n\n\nfastlane snapshot update\n\n\n\n\nto update your \nSnapshotHelper.swift\n files. In case you modified your \nSnapshotHelper.swift\n and want to manually update the file, check out \nSnapshotHelper.swift\n.\n\n\nLaunch Arguments\n\n\nYou can provide additional arguments to your app on launch. These strings will be available in your app (eg. not in the testing target) through \nProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments\n. Alternatively, use user-default syntax (\n-key value\n) and they will be available as key-value pairs in \nUserDefaults.standard\n.\n\n\nlaunch_arguments([\n  \n-firstName Felix -lastName Krause\n\n])\n\n\n\n\nname.text = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: \nfirstName\n)\n// name.text = \nFelix\n\n\n\n\n\nsnapshot\n includes \n-FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT YES\n, which will set a temporary user default for the key \nFASTLANE_SNAPSHOT\n, you may use this to detect when the app is run by \nsnapshot\n.\n\n\nif UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: \nFASTLANE_SNAPSHOT\n) {\n    // runtime check that we are in snapshot mode\n}\n\n\n\n\nSpecify multiple argument strings and \nsnapshot\n will generate screenshots for each combination of arguments, devices, and languages. This is useful for comparing the same screenshots with different feature flags, dynamic text sizes, and different data sets.\n\n\n# Snapfile for A/B Test Comparison\nlaunch_arguments([\n  \n-secretFeatureEnabled YES\n,\n  \n-secretFeatureEnabled NO\n\n])\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\nThe easiest solution would be to just render the UIWindow into a file. That's not possible because UI Tests don't run on a main thread. So \nsnapshot\n uses a different approach:\n\n\nWhen you run unit tests in Xcode, the reporter generates a plist file, documenting all events that occurred during the tests (\nMore Information\n). Additionally, Xcode generates screenshots before, during and after each of these events. There is no way to manually trigger a screenshot event. The screenshots and the plist files are stored in the DerivedData directory, which \nsnapshot\n stores in a temporary folder.\n\n\nWhen the user calls \nsnapshot(...)\n in the UI Tests (Swift or Objective C) the script actually does a rotation to \n.Unknown\n which doesn't have any effect on the actual app, but is enough to trigger a screenshot. It has no effect to the application and is not something you would do in your tests. The goal was to find \nsome\n event that a user would never trigger, so that we know it's from \nsnapshot\n. On tvOS, there is no orientation so we ask for a count of app views with type \"Browser\" (which should never exist on tvOS).\n\n\nsnapshot\n then iterates through all test events and check where we either did this weird rotation (on iOS) or searched for browsers (on tvOS). Once \nsnapshot\n has all events triggered by \nsnapshot\n it collects a ordered list of all the file names of the actual screenshots of the application.\n\n\nIn the test output, the Swift \nsnapshot\n function will print out something like this\n\n\n\n\nsnapshot: [some random text here]\n\n\n\n\nsnapshot\n finds all these entries using a regex. The number of \nsnapshot\n outputs in the terminal and the number of \nsnapshot\n events in the plist file should be the same. Knowing that, \nsnapshot\n automatically matches these 2 lists to identify the name of each of these screenshots. They are then copied over to the output directory and separated by language and device.\n\n\n2 thing have to be passed on from \nsnapshot\n to the \nxcodebuild\n command line tool:\n\n\n\n\nThe device type is passed via the \ndestination\n parameter of the \nxcodebuild\n parameter\n\n\nThe language is passed via a temporary file which is written by \nsnapshot\n before running the tests and read by the UI Tests when launching the application\n\n\n\n\nIf you find a better way to do any of this, please submit an issue on GitHub or even a pull request :+1:\n\n\nRadar \n23062925\n has been resolved with Xcode 8.3, so it's now possible to actually take screenshots from the simulator. We'll keep using the old approach for now, since many of you still want to use older versions of Xcode.\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\n\n  Check out the new \nfastlane documentation\n on how to generate screenshots\n\n\n\n\n\nFrame the screenshots\n\n\nIf you want to add frames around the screenshots and even put a title on top, check out \nframeit\n.\n\n\nAvailable language codes\n\n\nALL_LANGUAGES = [\nda\n, \nde-DE\n, \nel\n, \nen-AU\n, \nen-CA\n, \nen-GB\n, \nen-US\n, \nes-ES\n, \nes-MX\n, \nfi\n, \nfr-CA\n, \nfr-FR\n, \nid\n, \nit\n, \nja\n, \nko\n, \nms\n, \nnl-NL\n, \nno\n, \npt-BR\n, \npt-PT\n, \nru\n, \nsv\n, \nth\n, \ntr\n, \nvi\n, \nzh-Hans\n, \nzh-Hant\n]\n\n\n\n\nTo get more information about language and locale codes please read \nInternationalization and Localization Guide\n.\n\n\nUse a clean status bar\n\n\nYou can use \nSimulatorStatusMagic\n to clean up the status bar.\n\n\nEditing the \nSnapfile\n\n\nChange syntax highlighting to \nRuby\n.\n\n\nSimulator doesn't launch the application\n\n\nWhen the app dies directly after the application is launched there might be 2 problems\n\n\n\n\nThe simulator is somehow in a broken state and you need to re-create it.

This is the default behavior in order to take your screenshots as quickly as possible. This can be disabled to run each device, one at a time, by setting the  :concurrent_simulators  option to  false .  Note:  While running  snapshot  with Xcode 9, the simulators will not be visibly spawned. So, while you wont see the simulators running your tests, they will, in fact, be taking your screenshots.  If any error occurs while running the snapshot script on a device, that device will not have any screenshots, and  snapshot  will continue with the next device or language. To stop the flow after the first error, run  fastlane snapshot --stop_after_first_error  Also by default,  snapshot  will open the HTML after all is done. This can be skipped with the following command  fastlane snapshot --stop_after_first_error --skip_open_summary  There are a lot of options available that define how to build your app, for example  fastlane snapshot --scheme  UITests  --configuration  Release   --sdk  iphonesimulator   Reinstall the app before running  snapshot  fastlane snapshot --reinstall_app --app_identifier  tools.fastlane.app   By default  snapshot  automatically retries running UI Tests if they fail. This is due to randomly failing UI Tests (e.g.  #2517 ). You can adapt this number using  fastlane snapshot --number_of_retries 3  Add photos and/or videos to the simulator before running  snapshot  fastlane snapshot --add_photos MyTestApp/Assets/demo.jpg --add_videos MyTestApp/Assets/demo.mp4  For a list for all available options run  fastlane action snapshot  After running  snapshot  you will get a nice summary:",

            "text": "The easiest solution would be to just render the UIWindow into a file. That's not possible because UI Tests don't run on a main thread. So  snapshot  uses a different approach:  When you run unit tests in Xcode, the reporter generates a plist file, documenting all events that occurred during the tests ( More Information ). Additionally, Xcode generates screenshots before, during and after each of these events. There is no way to manually trigger a screenshot event. The screenshots and the plist files are stored in the DerivedData directory, which  snapshot  stores in a temporary folder.  When the user calls  snapshot(...)  in the UI Tests (Swift or Objective C) the script actually does a rotation to  .Unknown  which doesn't have any effect on the actual app, but is enough to trigger a screenshot. It has no effect to the application and is not something you would do in your tests. The goal was to find  some  event that a user would never trigger, so that we know it's from  snapshot . On tvOS, there is no orientation so we ask for a count of app views with type \"Browser\" (which should never exist on tvOS).  snapshot  then iterates through all test events and check where we either did this weird rotation (on iOS) or searched for browsers (on tvOS). Once  snapshot  has all events triggered by  snapshot  it collects a ordered list of all the file names of the actual screenshots of the application.  In the test output, the Swift  snapshot  function will print out something like this   snapshot: [some random text here]   snapshot  finds all these entries using a regex. The number of  snapshot  outputs in the terminal and the number of  snapshot  events in the plist file should be the same. Knowing that,  snapshot  automatically matches these 2 lists to identify the name of each of these screenshots. They are then copied over to the output directory and separated by language and device.  2 thing have to be passed on from  snapshot  to the  xcodebuild  command line tool:   The device type is passed via the  destination  parameter of the  xcodebuild  parameter  The language is passed via a temporary file which is written by  snapshot  before running the tests and read by the UI Tests when launching the application   If you find a better way to do any of this, please submit an issue on GitHub or even a pull request :+1:  Radar  23062925  has been resolved with Xcode 8.3, so it's now possible to actually take screenshots from the simulator.

This directory contains one or more locale directories (e.g. en-US, en-GB, etc.), and inside this directory are text files such as \ntitle.txt\n and \nshort_description.txt\n.\n\n\nInside of a given locale directory is a folder called \nimages\n. Here you can supply images with the following file names (extension can be png, jpg or jpeg):\n\n\n\n\nfeatureGraphic\n\n\nicon\n\n\npromoGraphic\n\n\ntvBanner\n\n\n\n\nAnd you can supply screenshots by creating directories with the following names, containing PNGs or JPEGs (image names are irrelevant):\n\n\n\n\nphoneScreenshots/\n\n\nsevenInchScreenshots/\n (7-inch tablets)\n\n\ntenInchScreenshots/\n (10-inch tablets)\n\n\ntvScreenshots/\n\n\nwearScreenshots/\n\n\n\n\nNote that these will replace the current images and screenshots on the play store listing, not add to them.\n\n\nChangelogs (What's new)\n\n\nYou can add changelog files under the \nchangelogs/\n directory for each locale. The filename should exactly match the version code of the APK that it represents. \nfastlane supply init\n will populate changelog files from existing data on Google Play if no \nmetadata/\n directory exists when it is run.\n\n\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 fastlane\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 metadata\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 android\n            \u251c\u2500\u2500 en-US\n            \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 changelogs\n            \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 100000.txt\n            \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 100100.txt\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 fr-FR\n                \u2514\u2500\u2500 changelogs\n                    \u2514\u2500\u2500 100100.txt\n\n\n\n\nTrack Promotion\n\n\nA common Play publishing scenario might involve uploading an APK version to a test track, testing it, and finally promoting that version to production.\n\n\nThis can be done using the \n--track_promote_to\n parameter.  The \n--track_promote_to\n parameter works with the \n--track\n parameter to command the Play API to promote existing Play track APK version(s) (those active on the track identified by the \n--track\n param value) to a new track (\n--track_promote_to\n value).\n\n\nRetrieve Track Version Codes\n\n\nBefore performing a new APK upload you may want to check existing track version codes, or you may simply want to provide an informational lane that displays the currently promoted version codes for the production track. You can use the \ngoogle_play_track_version_codes\n action to retrieve existing version codes for a package and track. For more information, see \nfastlane action google_play_track_version_codes\n help output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\n\nandroid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n@KrauseFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Examples\n\n\nupload_to_play_store\n\n\n\n\nsupply # alias for \nupload_to_play_store\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npackage_name\n\n\nThe package name of the application to use\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrack\n\n\nThe track of the application to use: production, beta, alpha, rollout\n\n\nproduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrollout\n\n\nThe percentage of the user fraction when uploading to the rollout track\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata_path\n\n\nPath to the directory containing the metadata files\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkey\n\n\n[DEPRECATED!] Use --json_key instead - The p12 File used to authenticate with Google\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nissuer\n\n\n[DEPRECATED!] Use --json_key instead - The issuer of the p12 file (email address of the service account)\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\njson_key\n\n\nThe service account json file used to authenticate with Google\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\njson_key_data\n\n\nThe service account json used to authenticate with Google\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\napk\n\n\nPath to the APK file to upload\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\napk_paths\n\n\nAn array of paths to APK files to upload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_upload_apk\n\n\nWhether to skip uploading APK\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_upload_metadata\n\n\nWhether to skip uploading metadata\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_upload_images\n\n\nWhether to skip uploading images, screenshots not included\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_upload_screenshots\n\n\nWhether to skip uploading SCREENSHOTS\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrack_promote_to\n\n\nThe track to promote to: production, beta, alpha, rollout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalidate_only\n\n\nOnly validate changes with Google Play rather than actually publish\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmapping\n\n\nPath to the mapping file to upload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmapping_paths\n\n\nAn array of paths to mapping files to upload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nroot_url\n\n\nRoot URL for the Google Play API.

Every team member with access to the repo can use those credentials for code signing. \nmatch\n also automatically repairs broken and expired credentials. It's the easiest way to share signing credentials across teams\n\n\nMore information on how to get started with codesigning\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nWhy?\n \n\n    \nUsage\n \n\n    \nIs this secure?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatch\n is part of \nfastlane\n: The easiest way to automate beta deployments and releases for your iOS and Android apps.\n\n\n\nWhy match?\n\n\nBefore starting to use \nmatch\n, make sure to read the \ncodesigning.guide\n\n\n\n\nWhen deploying an app to the App Store, beta testing service or even installing it on a device, most development teams have separate code signing identities for every member. This results in dozens of profiles including a lot of duplicates.\n\n\nYou have to manually renew and download the latest set of provisioning profiles every time you add a new device or a certificate expires. Additionally this requires spending a lot of time when setting up a new machine that will build your app.\n\n\n\n\nA new approach\n\n\n\n\nShare one code signing identity across your development team to simplify your setup and prevent code signing issues. What if there was a central place where your code signing identity and profiles are kept, so anyone in the team can access them during the build process?\n\n\n\n\nWhy not let Xcode handle all this?\n\n\n\n\nYou have full control over what happens\n\n\nYou have access to all the certificates and profiles, which are all securely stored in git\n\n\nYou share one code signing identity across the team to have fewer certificates and profiles\n\n\nXcode sometimes revokes certificates which breaks your setup causing failed builds\n\n\nMore predictable builds by settings profiles in an explicit way instead of using the \nAutomatic\n setting\n\n\nIt just works\u2122\n\n\n\n\nWhat does \nmatch\n do for you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd04\n\n\nAutomatically sync your iOS keys and profiles across all your team members using git\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udce6\n\n\nHandle all the heavy lifting of creating and storing your certificates and profiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcbb\n\n\nSetup codesigning on a new machine in under a minute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfaf\n\n\nDesigned to work with apps with multiple targets and bundle identifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd12\n\n\nYou have full control over your files and Git repo, no third party service involved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2728\n\n\nProvisioning profile will always match the correct certificate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udca5\n\n\nEasily reset your existing profiles and certificates if your current account has expired or invalid profiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u267b\ufe0f\n\n\nAutomatically renew your provisioning profiles to include all your devices using the \n--force\n option\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc65\n\n\nSupport for multiple Apple accounts and multiple teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2728\n\n\nTightly integrated with \nfastlane\n to work seamlessly with \ngym\n and other build tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the concept, visit \ncodesigning.guide\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nSetup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \nnew, private Git repo\n (e.g. on \nGitHub\n or \nBitBucket\n) and name it something like \ncertificates\n. \nImportant:\n Make sure the repository is set to \nprivate\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional: Create a \nnew, shared Apple Developer Portal account\n, something like \noffice@company.com\n that will be shared across your team from now on (for more information visit \ncodesigning.guide\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following in your project folder to start using \nmatch\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfastlane match init\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll be asked to enter the URL to your Git repo. This can be either a \nhttps://\n or a \ngit\n URL. (If your machine is currently using SSH to authenticate with GitHub, you'll want to use a \ngit\n URL, otherwise you may see an authentication error when you attempt to use match.) \nfastlane match init\n won't read or modify your certificates or profiles.\n\n\nThis will create a \nMatchfile\n in your current directory (or in your \n./fastlane/\n folder).\n\n\nExample content (for more advanced setups check out the \nfastlane section\n):\n\n\ngit_url(\nhttps://github.com/fastlane/certificates\n)\n\napp_identifier(\ntools.fastlane.app\n)\nusername(\nuser@fastlane.tools\n)\n\n\n\n\nImportant: Use one git branch per team\n\n\nmatch\n also supports storing certificates of multiple teams in one repo, by using separate git branches. If you work in multiple teams, make sure to set the \ngit_branch\n parameter to a unique value per team. From there, \nmatch\n will automatically create and use the specified branch for you.\n\n\nmatch(git_branch: \nteam1\n, username: \nuser@team1.com\n)\nmatch(git_branch: \nteam2\n, username: \nuser@team2.com\n)\n\n\n\n\nRun\n\n\n\n\nBefore running \nmatch\n for the first time, you should consider clearing your existing profiles and certificates using the \nmatch nuke command\n.\n\n\n\n\nAfter running \nfastlane match init\n you can run the following to generate new certificates and profiles:\n\n\nfastlane match appstore\n\n\n\n\nfastlane match development\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a new certificate and provisioning profile (if required) and store them in your Git repo. If you previously ran \nmatch\n it will automatically install the existing profiles from the Git repo.\n\n\nThe provisioning profiles are installed in \n~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles\n while the certificates and private keys are installed in your Keychain.\n\n\nTo get a more detailed output of what \nmatch\n is doing use\n\n\nfastlane match --verbose\n\n\n\n\nFor a list of all available options run\n\n\nfastlane action match\n\n\n\n\nHandle multiple targets\n\n\nIf you have several targets with different bundle identifiers, supply them as a comma-separated list to   :\n\n\nfastlane match appstore -a tools.fastlane.app,tools.fastlane.app.watchkitapp\n\n\n\n\nYou can make this even easier using \nfastlane\n by creating a \ncertificates\n lane like this:\n\n\nlane :certificates do\n  match(app_identifier: [\ncom.krausefx.app1\n, \ncom.krausefx.app2\n, \ncom.krausefx.app3\n], readonly: true)\nend\n\n\n\n\nThen all your team has to do is \nfastlane certificates\n and keys, certs and profiles for all targets will be synced.\n\n\nPassphrase\n\n\nWhen running \nmatch\n for the first time on a new machine, it will ask you for the passphrase for the Git repository. This is an additional layer of security: each of the files will be encrypted using \nopenssl\n.

Usually you'd just add your CI's public ssh key as a deploy key to your \nmatch\n repo, but since your CI will already likely be using its public ssh key to access the codebase repo, \nyou won't be able to do that\n.\n\n\nSome repo hosts might allow you to use the same deploy key for different repos, but GitHub will not. If your host does, you don't need to worry about this, just add your CI's public ssh key as a deploy key for your \nmatch\n repo and scroll down to \"\nEncryption password\n\".\n\n\nThere are a few ways around this:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new account on your repo host with read-only access to your \nmatch\n repo. Bitrise have a good description of this \nhere\n.\n\n\nSome CIs allow you to upload your signing credentials manually, but obviously this means that you'll have to re-upload the profiles/keys/certs each time they change.\n\n\n\n\nNeither solution is pretty. It's one of those \ntrade-off\n things. Do you care more about \nnot\n having an extra account sitting around, or do you care more about having the :sparkles: of auto-syncing of credentials.\n\n\nEncryption password\n\n\nOnce you've decided which approach to take, all that's left to do is to set your encryption password as secret environment variable named \nMATCH_PASSWORD\n. \nmatch\n will pick this up when it's run.\n\n\nNuke\n\n\nIf you never really cared about code signing and have a messy Apple Developer account with a lot of invalid, expired or Xcode managed profiles/certificates, you can use the \nmatch nuke\n command to revoke your certificates and provisioning profiles. Don't worry, apps that are already available in the App Store / TestFlight will still work. Builds distributed via Ad Hoc or Enterprise will be disabled after nuking your account, so you'll have to re-upload a new build. After clearing your account you'll start from a clean state, and you can run \nmatch\n to generate your certificates and profiles again.\n\n\nTo revoke all certificates and provisioning profiles for a specific environment:\n\n\nfastlane match nuke development\nfastlane match nuke distribution\nfastlane match nuke enterprise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll have to confirm a list of profiles / certificates that will be deleted.\n\n\nChange Password\n\n\nTo change the password of your repo and therefore decrypting and encrypting all files run\n\n\nfastlane match change_password\n\n\n\n\nYou'll be asked for the new password on all your machines on the next run.\n\n\nManual Decrypt\n\n\nIf you want to manually decrypt a file you can.\n\n\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -k \npassword\n -in \nfileYouWantToDecryptPath\n -out \ndecryptedFilePath\n -a -d\n\n\n\n\nIs this secure?\n\n\nBoth your keys and provisioning profiles are encrypted using OpenSSL using a passphrase.\n\n\nStoring your private keys in a Git repo may sound off-putting at first. We did an in-depth analysis of potential security issues and came to the following conclusions:\n\n\nWhat could happen if someone stole a private key?\n\n\nIf attackers would have your certificate and provisioning profile, they could codesign an application with the same bundle identifier.\n\n\nWhat's the worst that could happen for each of the profile types?\n\n\nApp Store Profiles\n\n\nAn App Store profile can't be used for anything as long as it's not re-signed by Apple. The only way to get an app resigned is to submit an app for review which could take anywhere from 24 hours to a few days (checkout \nappreviewtimes.com\n for up-to-date expectations). Attackers could only submit an app for review, if they also got access to your iTunes Connect credentials (which are not stored in git, but in your local keychain). Additionally you get an email notification every time a build gets uploaded to cancel the submission even before your app gets into the review stage.\n\n\nDevelopment and Ad Hoc Profiles\n\n\nIn general those profiles are harmless as they can only be used to install a signed application on a small subset of devices. To add new devices, the attacker would also need your Apple Developer Portal credentials (which are not stored in git, but in your local keychain).\n\n\nEnterprise Profiles\n\n\nAttackers could use an In-House profile to distribute signed application to a potentially unlimited number of devices. All this would run under your company name and it could eventually lead to Apple revoking your In-House account. However it is very easy to revoke a certificate to remotely break the app on all devices.\n\n\nBecause of the potentially dangerous nature of In-House profiles please use \nmatch\n with enterprise profiles with caution, ensure your git repository is private and use a secure password.\n\n\nTo sum up\n\n\n\n\nYou have full control over the access list of your Git repo, no third party service involved\n\n\nEven if your certificates are leaked, they can't be used to cause any harm without your iTunes Connect login credentials\n\n\nUse In-House enterprise profile with \nmatch\n with caution\n\n\nIf you use GitHub or Bitbucket we encourage enabling 2 factor authentication for all accounts that have access to the certificates repo\n\n\nThe complete source code of \nmatch\n is fully open source on \nGitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsync_code_signing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\n\nios\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n@KrauseFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Examples\n\n\nsync_code_signing(type: \nappstore\n, app_identifier: \ntools.fastlane.app\n)\n\n\n\n\nsync_code_signing(type: \ndevelopment\n, readonly: true)\n\n\n\n\nsync_code_signing(app_identifier: [\ntools.fastlane.app\n, \ntools.fastlane.sleepy\n])\n\n\n\n\nmatch   # alias for \nsync_code_signing\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit_url\n\n\nURL to the git repo containing all the certificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit_branch\n\n\nSpecific git branch to use\n\n\nmaster\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\nDefine the profile type, can be appstore, adhoc, development, enterprise\n\n\ndevelopment\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp_identifier\n\n\nThe bundle identifier(s) of your app (comma-separated)\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusername\n\n\nYour Apple ID Username\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkeychain_name\n\n\nKeychain the items should be imported to\n\n\nlogin.keychain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkeychain_password\n\n\nThis might be required the first time you access certificates on a new mac.

values\n\n\nDeliver has a special \ndefault\n language code which allows you to provide values that are not localized, and which will be used as defaults when you don\u2019t provide a specific localized value.\n\n\nIn order to use \ndefault\n, you will need to tell \ndeliver\n which languages your app uses. You can do this in either of two ways:\n1. Create the folders named with the language in the metadata folder (i.e. fastlane/metadata/en-US or fastlane/metadata/de-DE)\n2. Add the following to your \nDeliverfile\n \nlanguages(['en-US','de-DE'])\n\n\nYou can use this either in json within your \nDeliverfile\n and/or as folders in your metadata folder. \ndeliver\n will take the union of both language sets from the \nDeliverfile\n and from the metadata folder and create on single set of languages which will be enabled.\n\n\nImagine that you have localized data for the following language codes:  \nen-US, de-DE, el, it\n\n\nYou can set the following in your \nDeliverfile\n\n\nrelease_notes({\n  'default' =\n \nShiny and new\n,\n  'de-DE' =\n \nglaenzend und neu\n\n})\n\n\n\n\nDeliver will use \"Shiny and new\" for en-US, el and it.\n\n\nIt will use \"glaenzend und neu\" for de-DE.\n\n\nYou can do the same with folders\n\n\n   default\n      keywords.txt\n      marketing_url.txt\n      name.txt\n      privacy_url.txt\n      support_url.txt\n      release_notes.txt\n   en-US\n      description.txt\n   de-DE\n      description.txt\n   el\n      description.txt\n   it\n      description.txt\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, default values for keywords, urls, name and release notes are used in all localizations, but each language has a fully localized description\n\n\nAutomatically create screenshots\n\n\nIf you want to integrate \ndeliver\n with \nsnapshot\n, check out \nfastlane\n!\n\n\nJenkins integration\n\n\nDetailed instructions about how to set up \ndeliver\n and \nfastlane\n in \nJenkins\n can be found in the \nfastlane README\n.\n\n\nFirewall Issues\n\n\ndeliver\n uses the iTunes Transporter to upload metadata and binaries. In case you are behind a firewall, you can specify a different transporter protocol using\n\n\nDELIVER_ITMSTRANSPORTER_ADDITIONAL_UPLOAD_PARAMETERS=\n-t DAV\n fastlane deliver\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Proxy\n\n\niTunes Transporter is a Java application bundled with Xcode. In addition to utilizing the \nDELIVER_ITMSTRANSPORTER_ADDITIONAL_UPLOAD_PARAMETERS=\"-t DAV\"\n, you need to configure the transporter application to use the proxy independently from the system proxy or any environment proxy settings. You can find the configuration file within Xcode:\n\n\nTOOLS_PATH=$( xcode-select -p )\nREL_PATH='../Applications/Application Loader.app/Contents/itms/java/lib/net.properties'\necho \n$TOOLS_PATH/$REL_PATH\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd necessary proxy configuration values to the net.properties according to \nJava Proxy Configuration\n.\n\n\nAs an alternative to editing the properties files, proxy configuration can be specified on the command line directly:\n\n\nDELIVER_ITMSTRANSPORTER_ADDITIONAL_UPLOAD_PARAMETERS=\n-t DAV -Dhttp.proxyHost=myproxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080\n\n\n\n\n\nLimit\n\n\niTunes Connect has a limit of 150 binary uploads per day.\n\n\nEditing the \nDeliverfile\n\n\nChange syntax highlighting to \nRuby\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupload_to_app_store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\n\nios, mac\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n@KrauseFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Examples\n\n\nupload_to_app_store(\n  force: true, # Set to true to skip PDF verification\n  itc_provider: \nabcde12345\n # pass a specific value to the iTMSTransporter -itc_provider option\n)\n\n\n\n\ndeliver   # alias for \nupload_to_app_store\n\n\n\n\n\nappstore  # alias for \nupload_to_app_store\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusername\n\n\nYour Apple ID Username\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp_identifier\n\n\nThe bundle identifier of your app\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp\n\n\nThe app ID of the app you want to use/modify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedit_live\n\n\nModify live metadata, this option disables ipa upload and screenshot upload\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nipa\n\n\nPath to your ipa file\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg\n\n\nPath to your pkg file\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplatform\n\n\nThe platform to use (optional)\n\n\nios\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata_path\n\n\nPath to the folder containing the metadata files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscreenshots_path\n\n\nPath to the folder containing the screenshots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_binary_upload\n\n\nSkip uploading an ipa or pkg to iTunes Connect\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse_live_version\n\n\nForce usage of live version rather than edit version\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_screenshots\n\n\nDon't upload the screenshots\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp_version\n\n\nThe version that should be edited or created\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_metadata\n\n\nDon't upload the metadata (e.g. title, description).

This directory contains one or more locale directories (e.g. en-US, en-GB, etc.), and inside this directory are text files such as \ntitle.txt\n and \nshort_description.txt\n.\n\n\nInside of a given locale directory is a folder called \nimages\n. Here you can supply images with the following file names (extension can be png, jpg or jpeg):\n\n\n\n\nfeatureGraphic\n\n\nicon\n\n\npromoGraphic\n\n\ntvBanner\n\n\n\n\nAnd you can supply screenshots by creating directories with the following names, containing PNGs or JPEGs (image names are irrelevant):\n\n\n\n\nphoneScreenshots/\n\n\nsevenInchScreenshots/\n (7-inch tablets)\n\n\ntenInchScreenshots/\n (10-inch tablets)\n\n\ntvScreenshots/\n\n\nwearScreenshots/\n\n\n\n\nNote that these will replace the current images and screenshots on the play store listing, not add to them.\n\n\nChangelogs (What's new)\n\n\nYou can add changelog files under the \nchangelogs/\n directory for each locale. The filename should exactly match the version code of the APK that it represents. \nfastlane supply init\n will populate changelog files from existing data on Google Play if no \nmetadata/\n directory exists when it is run.\n\n\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 fastlane\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 metadata\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 android\n            \u251c\u2500\u2500 en-US\n            \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 changelogs\n            \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 100000.txt\n            \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 100100.txt\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 fr-FR\n                \u2514\u2500\u2500 changelogs\n                    \u2514\u2500\u2500 100100.txt\n\n\n\n\nTrack Promotion\n\n\nA common Play publishing scenario might involve uploading an APK version to a test track, testing it, and finally promoting that version to production.\n\n\nThis can be done using the \n--track_promote_to\n parameter.  The \n--track_promote_to\n parameter works with the \n--track\n parameter to command the Play API to promote existing Play track APK version(s) (those active on the track identified by the \n--track\n param value) to a new track (\n--track_promote_to\n value).\n\n\nRetrieve Track Version Codes\n\n\nBefore performing a new APK upload you may want to check existing track version codes, or you may simply want to provide an informational lane that displays the currently promoted version codes for the production track. You can use the \ngoogle_play_track_version_codes\n action to retrieve existing version codes for a package and track. For more information, see \nfastlane action google_play_track_version_codes\n help output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupload_to_play_store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\n\nandroid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n@KrauseFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Examples\n\n\nupload_to_play_store\n\n\n\n\nsupply # alias for \nupload_to_play_store\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npackage_name\n\n\nThe package name of the application to use\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrack\n\n\nThe track of the application to use: production, beta, alpha, rollout\n\n\nproduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrollout\n\n\nThe percentage of the user fraction when uploading to the rollout track\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata_path\n\n\nPath to the directory containing the metadata files\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkey\n\n\n[DEPRECATED!] Use --json_key instead - The p12 File used to authenticate with Google\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nissuer\n\n\n[DEPRECATED!] Use --json_key instead - The issuer of the p12 file (email address of the service account)\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\njson_key\n\n\nThe service account json file used to authenticate with Google\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\njson_key_data\n\n\nThe service account json used to authenticate with Google\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\napk\n\n\nPath to the APK file to upload\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\napk_paths\n\n\nAn array of paths to APK files to upload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_upload_apk\n\n\nWhether to skip uploading APK\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_upload_metadata\n\n\nWhether to skip uploading metadata\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_upload_images\n\n\nWhether to skip uploading images, screenshots not included\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskip_upload_screenshots\n\n\nWhether to skip uploading SCREENSHOTS\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrack_promote_to\n\n\nThe track to promote to: production, beta, alpha, rollout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalidate_only\n\n\nOnly validate changes with Google Play rather than actually publish\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmapping\n\n\nPath to the mapping file to upload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmapping_paths\n\n\nAn array of paths to mapping files to upload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nroot_url\n\n\nRoot URL for the Google Play API.

This guide will help you choose the best approach for you.\n\n\nFor existing projects it might make sense to switch from a manual process to the \nmatch approach\n to make it easier for new team-members to onboard.\n\n\nIf you are new to code signing, check out the \nWWDC session\n that describes the fundamentals of code signing in Xcode.\n\n\n\n\nUsing match\n\n\nUsing cert and sigh\n\n\nUsing Xcode's code signing feature\n\n\nManually\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nmatch\n\n\nThe concept of \nmatch\n is described in the \ncodesigning guide\n. \n\n\nWith \nmatch\n you store your private keys and certificates in a git repo to sync them across machines.

Since Xcode can auto-generate these for you, there is no need to share them between teammates' computers. As such, when using Xcode Automatic Provisioning, there is no need to use \nmatch development\n to keep development keys, certificates, and provisioning profiles in sync.\n\n\nIf you are already using \nmatch\n to manage development code signing, Automatic Provisioning will use the \nmatch\n-generated key and certificate.

To securely store your private key and have access to it from all your devices, use \nmatch appstore\n or \nmatch adhoc\n. This will sync your keys, certificates and provisioning profiles via git, encrypted using OpenSSL.\n\n\nXcode 7 and lower\n\n\nNote\n: This approach is deprecated with Xcode 8\n\n\nIf you use \nAutomatic\n value for your provisioning profile, Xcode sometimes selects the wrong profile, resulting in code signing errors at a later point.\n\n\nInstead it is recommended to specify a specific provisioning profile, which can only be done using the UUID (in Xcode 7).\n\n\nSince it is not recommended to update the project file, every time you update your provisioning profile, you can pass the UUID via environment variables.\n\n\nTo do so, open your target settings, open the dropdown for \nProvisioning Profile\n and select \nOther\n:\n\n\n\n\nUsing the \n$(...)\n notation, Xcode will use the provisioning profile matching the UUID, and fallback to \nAutomatic\n if it's not provided.\n\n\nIf you use \nfastlane\n you don't have to do any extra work, since the environment variable for the latest profile are automatically set by \nmatch\n\n\nlane :beta do\n  match(type: \nadhoc\n)\n  gym\nend\n\n\n\n\nYou can also manually set the environment variable using\n\n\nlane :beta do\n  ENV[\nPROVISIONING_PROFILE_TARGET1\n] = \nb01c39c9-1b4a-412e-9ae2-3087ee9ea9d3\n\n  gym\nend",

Something else is erroring out at a lower level so you'll need to dig in to find out what.\n\n\nThe archive built successfully, but the export step failed\n\n\nTypically, your archive will build nicely, and with the correct provisioning profile; you can inspect the \n.xcarchive\n package to verify the \nembedded.mobileprovision\n file matches.\n\n\nWhat happens is the export step will possibly sign it with a different profile depending on which \nexport_method\n you're choosing (with \ndevelopment\n being the default) and it is during this step that the process will fail.\n\n\nThis allows you to isolate the error to the export step, under most circumstances.\n\n\nDependency on other gems\n\n\nThe export step sometimes fails due to not having these Ruby gems installed and caused many of the old instances of this problem.\n\n\n\n\nCFPropertyList\n\n\nsqlite3\n\n\ndigest\n\n\n\n\nYou can use \n$ gem list\n to show which gems are installed\n\n\nRuby version\n\n\nMany of the old instances of this problem were caused by not using \nsystem\n Ruby, but this likely won't impact many in the future since \nfastlane\n helps ensure your environment is set up properly now.\n\n\nUsing \nRVM\n or newer versions of Ruby should work fine.

The action you create will behave exactly like the built in actions.\n\n\nJust run \nfastlane new_action\n, enter the name of the action and edit the generated Ruby file in \nfastlane/actions/[action_name].rb\n. After you finished writing your action, add it to your version control, so it is available for your whole team.\n\n\nFrom then on, you can just use your action in your \nFastfile\n, just like any other action.\n\n\nSubmitting the action to the fastlane main repo\n\n\nPlease be aware we may not accept all actions submitted to be bundled with \nfastlane\n. Before you submit a pull request adding the action to the \nfastlane\n code base, submit an issue proposing the new action and why it should be built-in.\n\n\nIn general we tend to accept actions that\n\n\n\n\nGenerally usable for a big majority of developers (e.g. basic interactions with git)\n\n\nSolve pain points for mobile app developers (iOS and Android)\n\n\nhave an easy to read documentation and great test coverage\n\n\n\n\nIn general, we might not accept actions that\n\n\n\n\nSolve specific use-cases for only a small subset of developers\n\n\nAccess the API of a third party service, the third party service should own and maintain the action\n\n\nComplex actions, that will require a lot of work to maintain in the future\n\n\nEverything that isn't mobile developer related\n\n\n\n\nPlugins\n\n\nfastlane\n is an open platform and we enable every developer to extend it to fit their needs. That's why we built a plugin system that allows you and your company to provide \nfastlane\n plugins to other \nfastlane\n users. You have the full power and responsibility of maintaining your plugin and keeping it up to date. This is useful if you maintain your own library or web service, and want to make sure the \nfastlane\n plugin is always up to date.\n\n\nFind a plugin\n\n\nHead over to \nAvailable Plugins\n for a list of plugins you can use.\n\n\nList all available plugins using\n\n\nfastlane search_plugins\n\n\n\n\nTo search for something specific\n\n\nfastlane search_plugins [query]\n\n\n\n\nAdd a plugin to your project\n\n\nfastlane add_plugin [name]\n\n\n\n\nfastlane\n will assist you on setting up your project to start using plugins.\n\n\nThis will:\n\n\n\n\nAdd the plugin to \nfastlane/Pluginfile\n\n\nMake sure your \nfastlane/Pluginfile\n is properly referenced from your \n./Gemfile\n\n\nRun \nfastlane install_plugins\n to make sure all required dependencies are installed on your local machine (this step might ask for your admin password to install Ruby gems)\n\n\nYou'll have 3 new files, that should all be checked into version control: \nGemfile\n, \nGemfile.lock\n and \nfastlane/Pluginfile\n\n\n\n\nPlugin Source\n\n\nYour \nfastlane/Pluginfile\n contains the list of all \nfastlane\n plugins your project uses. The \nPluginfile\n is a \nGemfile\n that gets imported from your main \nGemfile\n.\nYou specify all dependencies, including the required version numbers:\n\n\n# Fetched from RubyGems.org\ngem \nfastlane-plugin-xcversion\n\n\n# Fetched from GitHub\ngem \nfastlane-plugin-xcversion\n, git: \nhttps://github.com/fastlane/fastlane-plugin-xcversion\n\n\n# Fetched from a local directory\ngem \nfastlane-plugin-xcversion\n, path: \n../fastlane-plugin-xcversion\n\n\n# Specify a version requirements\ngem \nfastlane-plugin-xcversion\n, \n1.1.0\n\ngem \nfastlane-plugin-xcversion\n, \n= 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information about a Gemfile\n\n\nInstall plugins on another machine\n\n\nTo make sure all plugins are installed on the local machine, run\n\n\nfastlane install_plugins\n\n\n\n\nRemove a plugin\n\n\nOpen your \nfastlane/Pluginfile\n and remove the line that looks like this\n\n\ngem \nfastlane-plugin-[plugin_name]\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate your own plugin\n\n\ncd ~/new/folder/\n\nfastlane new_plugin [plugin_name]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfastlane\n creates the directory structure that's needed to be a valid Ruby gem\n\n\nEdit the \nlib/fastlane/plugin/[plugin_name]/actions/[plugin_name].rb\n and implement your action\n\n\nEasily test the plugin locally by running \nfastlane add_plugin\n in your project's directory and specifying the local path when asked for it\n\n\n\n\nNew plugin for existing gem\n\n\nIf you already have an existing gem you want to provide a \nfastlane\n plugin for, you'll still have to create a new Ruby gem. The reason for that is the way plugins are imported.\n\n\nThe example project \nxcake\n contains a folder named \nfastlane-plugin-xcake\n.\n\n\nAll you have to do if you have an existing gem:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your gem\n\n\nfastlane new_plugin [plugin_name]\n\n\nInside the newly created folder, edit the \nfastlane-plugin-[plugin_name].gemspec\n and add your gem as a dependency. It is recommended to also specify a version number requirement\n\n\n\n\nPublishing your plugin\n\n\nRubyGems\n\n\nThe recommended way to publish your plugin is to publish it on \nRubyGems.org\n. Follow the steps below to publish your plugin.\n\n\n\n\nCreate an account at \nRubyGems.org\n\n\nPublish your plugin to a \nGitHub\n repo\n\n\nUpdate the \nfastlane-plugin-[plugin_name].gemspec\n file so that the \nspec.homepage\n points to your github repo.\n\n\nPublish the first release of your plugin:\n\n\n\n\nbundle install\nrake install\nrake release\n\n\n\n\nNow all your users can run \nfastlane add_plugin [plugin_name]\n to install and use your plugin.\n\n\nGitHub\n\n\nIf for some reason you don't want to use RubyGems, you can also make your plugin available on GitHub. Your users then need to add the following to the \nPluginfile\n\n\ngem \nfastlane-plugin-[plugin_name]\n, git: \nhttps://github.com/[user]/[plugin_name]\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\nMultiple actions in one plugin\n\n\nLet's assume you work on a \nfastlane\n plugin for project management software. You could call it \nfastlane-plugin-pm\n and it may contain any number of actions and helpers, just add them to your \nactions\n folder. Make sure to mention the available actions in your plugin's \nREADME.md\n.",

Additionally make sure the newly created Apple account has limited access to only the apps and resources it needs.\n\n\nThere are multiple reasons on why this approach is much easier:\n- An Apple ID session is only valid for a certain region, meaning if your CI system is in a different region than your local machine, you'll run into issues\n- An Apple ID session is only valid for up to a month, meaning you'll have to generate a new session every month. Usually you'd only know about it when your build starts failing\n\n\nThere is nothing \nfastlane\n can do better in that regard, as these are technical limitations on how iTunes Connect sessions are handled.\n\n\nCreating a separate Apple ID allows you to limit the permission scope, have a randomly generated password, and will make it much easier for you to set up CI using \nfastlane\n.\n\n\nUse of application specific passwords and \nspaceauth\n\n\nBefore going through this guide, make sure to read the section above.\n\n\nIf you want to upload builds to TestFlight/iTunes Connect from your CI machine, you need to generate an application specific password:\n\n\n\n\nVisit \nappleid.apple.com/account/manage\n\n\nGenerate a new application specific password\n\n\nProvide the application specific password using the environment variable \nFASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD\n\n\n\n\nBecause your CI machine will not be able to prompt you for your two-step or two-factor auth information, you also need to generate a login session for your CI machine in advance. You can get this by running:\n\n\nfastlane spaceauth -u user@email.com\n\n\n\n\nThis will generate a token you can set using the \nFASTLANE_SESSION\n environment variable on your CI system.\n\n\nEnvironment variables to set\n\n\nMost setups will need the following environment variables\n\n\n\n\nFASTLANE_USER\n: Your iTunes Connect / Dev Portal user, if your \nfastlane\n setup accesses iTC or the DevPortal (e.g. submit a TestFlight build, create a profile, ...)\n\n\nFASTLANE_PASSWORD\n: Your iTunes Connect / Dev Portal password, usually only needed if you also set the \nFASTLANE_USER\n variable\n\n\nMATCH_PASSWORD\n: You need to provide the password of your \nmatch\n encryption if you use \nmatch\n\n\nFASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD\n: You need to provide an \napplication specific password\n if you have 2-factor enabled and use \npilot\n or \ndeliver\n to upload a binary to iTunes Connect\n\n\nLANG\n and \nLC_ALL\n: These set up the locale your shell and all the commands you execute run at. \nfastlane\n needs these to be set to an UTF-8 locale to work correctly, for example \nen_US.UTF-8\n. Many CI systems come with a locale that is unset or set to ASCII by default, so make sure to double-check whether yours is set correctly.\n\n\n\n\nDeploy Strategy\n\n\nYou should \nnot\n deploy a new App Store update after every commit, since you still have to wait 1-2 days for the review. Instead it is recommended that you use Git Tags, or custom triggers to deploy a new update.\n\n\nYou can set up your own \nRelease\n job, which is only triggered manually.\n\n\nfastlane.ci\n\n\nSince January 2018, the \nfastlane\n team started working on \nfastlane.ci\n, an open source, self hosted, mobile optimized CI powered by \nfastlane\n.\n\n\nIt's still an early work in progress, and will take some time to be ready for production.\n\n\nJenkins Integration\n\n\nDeploying from your own computer isn't cool. You know what's cool? Letting a remote server publish app updates for you.\n\n\nfastlane\n automatically generates a JUnit report for you. This allows Continuous Integration systems, like \nJenkins\n, access the results of your deployment.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nThe recommended way to install \nJenkins\n is through \nhomebrew\n:\n\n\nbrew update \n brew install jenkins\n\n\n\n\nFrom now on start \nJenkins\n by running:\n\n\njenkins\n\n\n\n\nTo store the password in the Keychain of your remote machine, it is recommended that you run \nmatch\n or \ndeliver\n using ssh or remote desktop at least once.\n\n\nRuby Environment\n\n\nWe recommend using \nrbenv\n for installing Ruby, though \nrvm\n and the version of Ruby that comes bundled on macOS are fine too.\n\n\nIf using a Gemfile in your project, add an \"Execute shell\" step as your first build step and call \nbundle update\n.\n\n\nPlugins\n\n\nYou'll find the following Jenkins plugins to be useful:\n\n\n(note: We do not recommend installing the Xcode plugin)\n\n\n\n\nHTML Publisher Plugin\n:\n Can be used to show the generated screenshots right inside Jenkins.\n\n\nAnsiColor Plugin\n:\n Used to show the coloured output of the fastlane tools. Don\u2019t forget to enable \nColor ANSI Console Output\n in the \nBuild Environment\n or your project.\n\n\nRebuild Plugin\n:\n This plugin will save you a lot of time.\n\n\nKeychains and Provisioning Profiles Plugin\n:\n Manages keychains across Jenkins installations.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Step\n\n\nAdd an \"Execute shell\" build step using your appropriate \nfastlane\n command per the example below:\n\n\nfastlane appstore\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nappstore\n with the lane you want to use.\n\n\n(note: if using a Gemfile, prefix that command with \nbundle exec\n)\n\n\nsetup_jenkins\n\n\nYou can use \nsetup_jenkins\n action which integrates well with the \nKeychains and Provisioning Profiles Plugin\n. Selected keychain will automatically unlocked and the selected code signing identity will be used. Also all build results, like IPA files, archives, dSYMs and result bundles will be stored in the \n./output\n folder in the job workspace. In additions \nsetup_jenkins\n will create separate derived data folder for each job (in the \n./derivedData\n).\n\n\nUnder the hood \nsetup_jenkins\n configures other actions like: \ngym\n, \nscan\n, \nxcodebuild\n, \nbackup_xcarchive\n and \nclear_derived_data\n.\n\n\ncommit_version_bump || git_commit\n\n\nYou can use \ncommit_version_bump\n or \ngit_commit\n action to commit changes to your repository in your fastlane setup. When you are using webhooks to trigger your build on a push this will cause an infinite loop of triggering builds.\n\n\nGitlab\n\n\nWhen you are using Gitlab you will need the \nGitLab Plugin\n. Inside the job you want to configure you go to \nBuild Triggers \n Build when a change is pushed to GitLab \n Enable [ci-skip]\n.\nWhen you include \n[ci-skip]\n in your build this commit won't trigger the build in jenkins at all.\n\n\nExample\n  \n\n\nbuild_number = increment_build_number\ncommit_version_bump(message:\n[ci-skip] Version Bump to #{build_number}\n)\ngit_commit(path:\n./CHANGELOG.md\n, message:\n[ci-skip] Updated CHANGELOG for Build #{build_number}\n)\npush_to_git_remote\n\n\n\n\nTest Results and Screenshots\n\n\nTo show the \ndeployment result\n right in \nJenkins\n\n\n\n\nAdd post-build action\n\n\nPublish JUnit test result report\n\n\nTest report XMLs\n: \nfastlane/report.xml\n\n\n\n\nTo show the \ngenerated screenshots\n right in \nJenkins\n\n\n\n\nAdd post-build action\n\n\nPublish HTML reports\n\n\nHTML directory to archive\n: \nfastlane/screenshots\n\n\nIndex page\n: \nscreenshots.html\n\n\n\n\nSave and run. The result should look like this:\n\n\n\n\nCircleCI Integration\n\n\nTo run fastlane on CircleCI, first create a \nGemfile\n in the root of your project with the following content:\n\n\n# Gemfile\nsource \nhttps://rubygems.org\n\n\ngem \nfastlane\n\n\n\n\n\nand run\n\n\ngem install bundler \n bundle update\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a \nGemfile.lock\n that defines all Ruby dependencies.  Make sure\nto commit both files to version control.\n\n\nNext, add the following to your \nFastfile\n:\n\n\n# fastlane/Fastfile\n\n...\nplatform :ios do\n  before_all do\n    setup_circle_ci\n  end\n  ...\nend\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsetup_circle_ci\n \nfastlane\n action will perform the following actions:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new temporary keychain for use with\n  \nmatch\n (see the \nCircleCI code signing\n  doc\n for more details).\n\n\nSwitch \nmatch\n to readonly mode to make sure CI does not create new\n  code signing certificates or provisioning profiles.\n\n\nSet up log and test result paths to be easily collectible.\n\n\n\n\nNext, create a \n.circleci\n directory in your project and add a\n\n.circleci/config.yml\n with the following content:\n\n\n# .circleci/config.yml\n\nversion: 2\njobs:\n  build:\n    macos:\n      xcode: \n9.0\n\n    working_directory: /Users/distiller/project\n    environment:\n      FL_OUTPUT_DIR: output\n      FASTLANE_LANE: test\n    shell: /bin/bash --login -o pipefail\n    steps:\n      - checkout\n      - restore_cache:\n          key: 1-gems-{{ checksum \nGemfile.lock\n }}\n      - run: bundle check || bundle install --path vendor/bundle\n      - save_cache:\n          key: 1-gems-{{ checksum \nGemfile.lock\n }}\n          paths:\n            - vendor/bundle\n      - run:\n          name: fastlane\n          command: bundle exec fastlane $FASTLANE_LANE\n      - store_artifacts:\n          path: output\n      - store_test_results:\n          path: output/scan\n\n\n\n\nThis will do the following:\n\n Create and use a Ruby gems cache.\n\n Run the test lane on all pushes.\n* Collect Junit test results and store log output in the Artifacts tab.\n\n\nCheck out \nthe CircleCI iOS\ndoc\n\nfor more detailed examples of using fastlane on CircleCI.\n\n\nTravis Integration\n\n\nUpdate your \n.travis.yml\n to look like this:\n\n\nlanguage: objective-c\nosx_image: xcode8.3\ninstall:\n  - bundle install\nscript:\n  - fastlane beta\n\n\n\n\nThe above config files assume you have a \nGemfile\n set up, if you don't have one yet, make sure to follow our \nGemfile guide\n and run \nbundle update\n to make sure you're using the most recent \nfastlane\n release.\n\n\nReplace \nbeta\n with the lane you want to run for your setup. If you want to build, sign and distribute builds from Travis, you'll need to add one more action to your \nFastfile\n, as by default, the Travis keychain is locked.\n\n\nAt the top of your \nFastfile\n, add\n\n\nsetup_travis\n\n\n\n\nwhich will setup the keychain to work well with \nmatch\n and \ngym\n. This action will also enable the \nreadonly\n mode for \nmatch\n, so your CI doesn't create new certificates or provisioning profiles.\n\n\nBamboo Integration\n\n\nRepository setup\n\n\nIn bamboo under \nLinked Repositories\n (where you configure your git repo) under \nAdvanced Settings\n is an option called \nExclude changesets\n\n\nThis dialog will allow you to enter a regular expression that if a commit matches, a build will not be triggered.\n\n\nFor example, if your \nFastfile\n is configured to make a commit message in the style of\n\n\nBuild Version bump by fastlane to Version [0.3] Build [8]\n\n\n\n\nThen you could use the following regex to ignore these commits\n\n\n^.*Build Version bump by fastlane.*$\n\n\n\n\nSetting repository remote\n\n\nBy default bamboo will do an anonymous shallow clone of the repo.  This will not preserve the  \ngit remote\n information nor the list of tags.  If you are using bamboo to create commits you may want to use a code block similar to the following:\n\n\n# In prep for eventually committing a version/build bump - set the git params\nsh('git config user.name \nCOMMITTER USERNAME\n')\nsh('git config user.email \nCOMITTER EMAIL\n')\n\n# Bamboo does an anonymous checkout so in order to update the build versions must set the git repo URL\ngit_remote_cmd = 'git remote set-url origin ' + ENV['bamboo_repository_git_repositoryUrl']\nsh(git_remote_cmd)\n\n\n\n\nSpeeding up build times with carthage\n\n\nCarthage is a wonderful dependency manager but once you are start using a large number of frameworks, things can start to slow down, especially if your CI server has to run \ncarthage\n EVERY time you check in a small line of code.\n\n\nOne way to make build times faster is to break your work up into two separate build plans (\nthis can get even more funky if you start having multiple branches\n)\n\n\nThe general idea is to make a build plan: \nProject - Artifacts\n that builds the \nCarthage\n directory and stores it as a shared artifact.  Then you create a second build plan \nProject - Fastlane\n that pulls down the \nCarthage\n directory and runs \nfastlane\n.\n\n\nArtifact Plan\n\n\nUse a simple setup to create this build plan. First off you want to make sure this plan is manually triggered only - because you only need to run it whenever the \nCartfile\n changes as opposed to after ever single commit.  It could also be on a nightly build perhaps if you desire.\n\n\nStages / Jobs / Tasks\n\n\nThis plan consists of 1 Job, 1 Stage and 2 Tasks\n\n\n\n\nTask 1: \nSource Code Checkout\n\n\nTask 2: \nScript\n (\ncarthage update\n)\n\n\n\n\nArtifact definitions\n\n\nCreate a shared artifact with the following info:\n\n\n\n\nName:\n CarthageFolder\n\n\nLocation:\n (leave blank)\n\n\nCopy Pattern:\n Carthage/Build/**\n\n\n\n\nOptional\n: You may want to automatically make the \nfastlane plan\n trigger whenever this plan is built\n\n\nfastlane\n plan\n\n\nWhen configuring \nfastlane\n to run in this setup you need to make sure that you are not calling either:\n\n\nreset_git_repo(force: true)\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nensure_git_status_clean\n\n\n\n\nas these calls will either fail the build or delete the \nCarthage\n directory.  Additionally you want to remove any \ncarthage\n tasks from inside your \nFastfile\n as \ncarthage\n is now happening externally to the build.\n\n\nBuild plan setup\n\n\nWhat this build plan does is it checks out the source code, then it downloads the entire \nCarthage/Build/\n directory into your local project - which is exactly what would be created from \ncarthage bootstrap\n and then it runs \nfastlane\n\n\n\n\nTask 1: \nSource Code Checkout\n\n\nTask 2: \nArtifact Download\n\n\nTask 3: \nfastlane\n\n\n\n\nGitLab CI Integration\n\n\nUse \nGitLab CI Runner\n running on a macOS machine\nto build using fastlane.\n\n\nRepository setup\n\n\nFirst create a \nGemfile\n in the root of your project with the following content:\n\n\nsource \nhttps://rubygems.org\n\n\ngem \nfastlane\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a \n.gitlab-ci.yml\n file to trigger \nfastlane\n.\n\n\nstages:\n  - unit_tests\n  - test_flight\n\nvariables:\n  LC_ALL: \nen_US.UTF-8\n\n  LANG: \nen_US.UTF-8\n\n\nbefore_script:\n  - gem install bundler\n  - bundle install\n\nunit_tests:\n  dependencies: []\n  stage: unit_tests\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - fastlane/screenshots\n      - fastlane/logs\n  script:\n    - fastlane tests\n  tags:\n    - ios\n\ntest_flight_build:\n  dependencies: []\n  stage: test_flight\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - fastlane/screenshots\n      - fastlane/logs\n  script:\n    - fastlane beta\n  tags:\n    - ios\n  only:\n     - /^release-.*$/\n     - master\n\n\n\n\nSee \nthe \n.gitlab-ci.yml\n documentation\n\nfor more information on how this file works.\n\n\nSetting up the lanes\n\n\nYou should have a lane - in this example called \nbeta\n - which should do the usual, \nmatch\n, \ngym\n, \npilot\n, to distribute an updated Test Flight version, and one lane \ntests\n which calls \nscan\n to run UI Tests.\n\n\nAuto-incremented build number.\n\n\nTo get an auto-incremented build number you can use something like the following lane:\n\n\nlane :increment_build_number do\n  increment_build_number(build_number: ENV['CI_BUILD_ID'])\nend\n\n\n\n\nThen the GitLab CI build ID (which iterates on each build) will be used.\n\n\nVisual Studio Team Services\n\n\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) use \nfastlane\n in their \nApple App Store\n extension.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nOnce you have created or retrieved credentials for your App Store account, then perform the following steps to automate releasing updates from a VSTS build or release definition:\n1. Install the App Store extension from the VSTS Marketplace\n1. Go to your VSTS or TFS project, click on the \nBuild\n tab, and create a new build definition (the \"+\" icon) that is hooked up to your project's appropriate source repo\n1. Click \nAdd build step...\n and select the necessary tasks to generate your release assets (e.g. Gulp, Cordova Build)\n1. Click \nAdd build step...\n and select \nApp Store Release\n from the \nDeploy\n category\n1. Configure the \nApp Store Release\n task with the desired authentication method, the generated IPA file path, and the desired release track.\n\n\nNow when you build, your app will automatically be published to \niTunes Connect\n!\n\n\nConfiguring \nfastlane\n versions\n\n\nThe extension can be configured to install the latest version of \nfastlane\n or a specific version of \nfastlane\n:\n1. In the Build for your project, click on the \nApple App Store\n task (supported in both \nApple App Store Release\n and \nApple App Store Promote\n), go to the \nAdvanced\n section of the Task, click \nInstall fastlane\n\n1. Optionally, select \nSpecific Version\n from \nfastlane version\n, and enter a specific version of \nfastlane\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nFor more documentation, see the \nApple App Store\n in the Visual Studio Team Server marketplace.",

Additionally make sure the newly created Apple account has limited access to only the apps and resources it needs.  There are multiple reasons on why this approach is much easier:\n- An Apple ID session is only valid for a certain region, meaning if your CI system is in a different region than your local machine, you'll run into issues\n- An Apple ID session is only valid for up to a month, meaning you'll have to generate a new session every month. Usually you'd only know about it when your build starts failing  There is nothing  fastlane  can do better in that regard, as these are technical limitations on how iTunes Connect sessions are handled.  Creating a separate Apple ID allows you to limit the permission scope, have a randomly generated password, and will make it much easier for you to set up CI using  fastlane .",

When defining a new lane \nfastlane\n will make sure to not run into any name conflicts. If you want to overwrite an existing lane (from the imported one), use the \noverride_lane\n keyword.\n\n\nEnvironment Variables\n\n\nYou can define environment variables in a \n.env\n or \n.env.default\n file in the same directory as your \nFastfile\n. Environment variables are loaded using \ndotenv\n. Here's an example:\n\n\nWORKSPACE=YourApp.xcworkspace\nHOCKEYAPP_API_TOKEN=your-hockey-api-token\n\n\n\n\nfastlane\n also has a \n--env\n option that allows loading of environment specific \ndotenv\n files. \n.env\n and \n.env.default\n will be loaded before environment specific \ndotenv\n files are loaded. The naming convention for environment specific \ndotenv\n files is \n.env.\nenvironment\n\n\nFor example, \nfastlane \nlane-name\n --env development\n will load \n.env\n, \n.env.default\n, and \n.env.development\n\n\nAlternatively, as environment variables are not a fastlane specific thing, you can also use standard methods to set them:\n\n\nDELIVER_USER=\nfelix@krausefx.com\n fastlane test\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nexport DELIVER_USER=\nfelix@krausefx.com\n;\nfastlane test\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it kind of defeats the purpose of using them in the first place (not to have their content in any files), you can also set them in your \nFastfile\n:\n\n\nENV[\nDELIVER_USER\n] = \nfelix@krausefx.com\n\n\n\n\n\nLane Properties\n\n\nIt can be useful to dynamically access properties of the current lane. These are available in \nlane_context\n:\n\n\nlane_context[SharedValues::PLATFORM_NAME]        # Platform name, e.g. `ios`, `android` or empty (for root level lanes)\nlane_context[SharedValues::LANE_NAME] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  # The name of the current lane preceded by the platform name (stays the same when switching lanes)\nlane_context[SharedValues::DEFAULT_PLATFORM]     # Default platform\n\n\n\n\nand environment variables:\n\n\nENV[\nFASTLANE_PLATFORM_NAME\n]\nENV[\nFASTLANE_LANE_NAME\n]\n\n\n\n\nLane Context\n\n\nThe different actions can \ncommunicate\n with each other using a shared hash. You can access this in your lanes with the following code:\n\n\nlane_context[SharedValues::VARIABLE_NAME_HERE]\n\n\n\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n\nlane_context[SharedValues::BUILD_NUMBER]                # Generated by `increment_build_number`\nlane_context[SharedValues::VERSION_NUMBER]              # Generated by `increment_version_number`\nlane_context[SharedValues::SNAPSHOT_SCREENSHOTS_PATH]   # Generated by _snapshot_\nlane_context[SharedValues::PRODUCE_APPLE_ID]            # The Apple ID of the newly created app\nlane_context[SharedValues::IPA_OUTPUT_PATH]             # Generated by _gym_\nlane_context[SharedValues::DSYM_OUTPUT_PATH]            # Generated by _gym_\nlane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_PROFILE_PATH]           # Generated by _sigh_\nlane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_UDID]                   # The UDID of the generated provisioning profile\nlane_context[SharedValues::HOCKEY_DOWNLOAD_LINK]        # Generated by `hockey`\nlane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_APK_OUTPUT_PATH]      # Generated by `gradle`\nlane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_ALL_APK_OUTPUT_PATHS] # Generated by `gradle`\nlane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_FLAVOR]               # Generated by `gradle`\nlane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_BUILD_TYPE]           # Generated by `gradle`\n\n\n\n\nTo get information about available lane variables, run \nfastlane action [action_name]\n.\n\n\nPrivate lanes\n\n\nSometimes you might have a lane that is used from different lanes, for example:\n\n\nlane :production do\n  # ...\n  build(release: true)\n  appstore # Deploy to the AppStore\n  # ...\nend\n\nlane :beta do\n  # ...\n  build(release: false)\n  crashlytics # Distribute to testers\n  # ...\nend\n\nlane :build do |options|\n  # ...\n  ipa\n  # ...\nend\n\n\n\n\nIt probably doesn't make sense to execute the \nbuild\n lane directly using \nfastlane build\n. You can hide this lane using\n\n\nprivate_lane :build do |options|\n  # ...\nend\n\n\n\n\nThis will hide the lane from:\n\n\n\n\nfastlane lanes\n\n\nfastlane list\n\n\nfastlane docs\n\n\n\n\nAnd also, you can't call the private lane using \nfastlane build\n.\n\n\nThe resulting private lane can only be called from another lane using the lane switching technology.\n\n\nLoad own actions from external folder\n\n\nAdd this to the top of your \nFastfile\n.\n\n\nactions_path '../custom_actions_folder/'\n\n\n\n\nSkip update check when launching \nfastlane\n\n\nYou can set the environment variable \nFASTLANE_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK\n to skip the update check.\n\n\nHide changelog information at the end of running \nfastlane\n\n\nYou can set the environment variable \nFASTLANE_HIDE_CHANGELOG\n to hide the detailed changelog information when new \nfastlane\n versions are available.\n\n\nAdding Credentials\n\n\nYou can add credentials for use by \nfastlane\n to your keychain using the \nCredentialsManager\n command line interface. This is useful for situations like CI environments.\n\n\nAdding a Credential\n\n\nfastlane fastlane-credentials add --username felix@krausefx.com\nPassword: *********\nCredential felix@krausefx.com:********* added to keychain.\n\n\n\n\nRemoving a Credential\n\n\nfastlane fastlane-credentials remove --username felix@krausefx.com\npassword has been deleted.\n\n\n\n\nControl configuration by lane and by platform\n\n\nIn general, configuration files take only the first value given for a particular configuration item. That means that for an \nAppfile\n like the following:\n\n\napp_identifier \ncom.used.id\n\napp_identifier \ncom.ignored.id\n\n\n\n\n\nthe \napp_identfier\n will be \n\"com.used.id\"\n and the second value will be ignored. The \nfor_lane\n and \nfor_platform\n configuration blocks provide a limited exception to this rule.\n\n\nAll configuration files (Appfile, Matchfile, Screengrabfile, etc.) can use \nfor_lane\n and \nfor_platform\n blocks to control (and override) configuration values for those circumstances.\n\n\nfor_lane\n blocks will be called when the name of lane invoked on the command line matches the one specified by the block. So, given a \nScreengrabfile\n like:\n\n\nlocales ['en-US', 'fr-FR', 'ja-JP']\n\nfor_lane :screenshots_english_only do\n  locales ['en-US']\nend\n\nfor_lane :screenshots_french_only do\n  locales ['fr-FR']\nend\n\n\n\n\nlocales\n will have the values \n['en-US', 'fr-FR', 'ja-JP']\n by default, but will only have one value when running the \nfastlane screenshots_english_only\n or \nfastlane screenshots_french_only\n.\n\n\nfor_platform\n gives you similar control based on the platform for which you have invoked \nfastlane\n. So, for an \nAppfile\n configured like:\n\n\napp_identifier \ncom.default.id\n\n\nfor_lane :enterprise do\n  app_identifier \ncom.forlane.enterprise\n\nend\n\nfor_platform :mac do\n  app_identifier \ncom.forplatform.mac\n\n\n  for_lane :release do\n    app_identifier \ncom.forplatform.mac.forlane.release\n\n  end\nend\n\n\n\n\nyou can expect the \napp_identifier\n to equal \n\"com.forplatform.mac.forlane.release\"\n when invoking \nfastlane mac release\n.\n\n\nManually Manage the fastlane match Repo\n\n\nMost users can benefit from \nmatch\n's automatic management of the repo that stores certificates and provisioning profiles. From time to time, it may be necessary to manually change the files in this repo.\n\n\nFor example, \nfastlane\n requires admin access to the Apple Developer account to generate the appropriate files. If you are provided with an updated certificate or profile but do not have admin access, you can manually edit the repo.\n\n\n\n\nWarning:\n Manually editing your \nmatch\n repo can introduce unexpected behavior and is not recommended. Proceed with caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nBecause:\n\n\n\n\nfastlane\n encrypts the repo, and\n\n\nfastlane\n doesn't support manual edits to the repo\n\n\n\n\nit's necessary to manually decrypt, then modify, then encrypt, the repo to make any changes.\n\n\n\n\nThese instructions presuppose you already have \nfastlane\n \nmatch\n configured correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd13 Decryption Instructions\n\n\nThe easiest way to decrypt the repo is to use the \nfastlane\n \nmatch\n \nGitHelper\n class. You can do this from an interactive Ruby console:\n\n\n$ bundle console\nirb(main):001:0\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, require \nmatch\n and set the appropriate parameters:\n\n\nirb(main):001:0\n require 'match'\nirb(main):002:0\n git_url = 'https://github.com/fastlane/example-certificate-repo'\n=\n \nhttps://github.com/fastlane/example-certificate-repo\n\nirb(main):003:0\n shallow_clone = false\n=\n false\nirb(main):004:0\n manual_password = 'example-password'\n=\n \nexample-password\n\n\n\n\n\nNow call \nGitHelper.clone\n, which will clone and decrypt the repo for you. Assign the return value to \nworkspace\n, which we'll need later when we re-encrypt:\n\n\nirb(main):005:0\n workspace = Match::GitHelper.clone(git_url, shallow_clone, manual_password: manual_password)\n[14:49:30]: Cloning remote git repo...\n[14:49:31]: \ud83d\udd13  Successfully decrypted certificates repo\n=\n \n/var/folders/0j/29ytx6wx0fg86sznfb4mqdph0000gn/T/d20170314-14350-11hmdro\n\n\n\n\n\nThe directory beginning with \n/var/folders\n contains the decrypted git repo. Modify it as needed.\n\n\nIf you are updating a \n.p12\n file, ensure it's exported from the keychain without a password, since \nmatch\n doesn't support importing private keys with a password.\n\n\n\n\nWarning:\n Do \nnot\n commit your changes. Allow \nfastlane\n to do that for you.\n\n\n\n\nOnce your changes are made, we'll need to encrypt the repo and push it.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd12 Encryption Instructions\n\n\nIn the Ruby console, call \nGitHelper.commit_changes\n, passing in the commit message you want. For example:\n\n\nirb(main):006:0\n Match::GitHelper.commit_changes(workspace, \nremove password from p12 file\n, git_url)\n\n\n\n\nYour changes will be encrypted, committed, and pushed.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n If your keychain doesn't include the encryption passcode, you may be prompted for it. If so, just enter the same password you used to decrypt it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectory behavior\n\n\nfastlane\n was designed in a way that you can run \nfastlane\n from both the root directory of the project, and from the \n./fastlane\n sub-folder.\n\n\nTake this example \nFastfile\n on the path \nfastlane/Fastfile\n\n\nsh \npwd\n # =\n \n[root]/fastlane\n\nputs Dir.pwd # =\n \n[root]/fastlane\n\n\nlane :something do\n  sh \npwd\n # =\n \n[root]/fastlane\n\n  puts Dir.pwd # =\n \n[root]/fastlane\n\n\n  my_action\nend\n\n\n\n\nThe implementation of \nmy_action\n looks like this:\n\n\ndef run(params)\n  puts Dir.pwd # =\n \n[root]\n\nend\n\n\n\n\nNotice how every action and every plugin's code runs in the root of the project, while all user code from the \nFastfile\n runs inside the \n./fastlane\n directory. This is important to consider when migrating existing code from your \nFastfile\n into your own action or plugin. To change the directory manually you can use standard Ruby blocks:\n\n\nDir.chdir(\n..\n) do\n  # code here runs in the parent directory\nend\n\n\n\n\nThis behavior isn't great, and has been like this since the very early days of \nfastlane\n. As much as we'd like to change it, there is no good way to do so, without breaking thousands of production setups, so we decided to keep it as is for now.\n\n\nAppfile\n\n\nThe \nAppfile\n stores useful information that are used across all \nfastlane\n tools like your \nApple ID\n or the application \nBundle Identifier\n, to deploy your lanes faster and tailored on your project needs.\n\n\nThe \nAppfile\n has to be inside your \n./fastlane\n directory.\n\n\nBy default an \nAppfile\n looks like:\n\n\napp_identifier \nnet.sunapps.1\n # The bundle identifier of your app\napple_id \nfelix@krausefx.com\n  # Your Apple email address\n\n# You can uncomment the lines below and add your own\n# team selection in case you're in multiple teams\n# team_name \nFelix Krause\n\n# team_id \nQ2CBPJ58CA\n\n\n# To select a team for iTunes Connect use\n# itc_team_name \nCompany Name\n\n# itc_team_id \n18742801\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have different credentials for iTunes Connect and the Apple Developer Portal use the following code:\n\n\napp_identifier \ntools.fastlane.app\n       # The bundle identifier of your app\n\napple_dev_portal_id \nportal@company.com\n  # Apple Developer Account\nitunes_connect_id \ntunes@company.com\n     # iTunes Connect Account\n\nteam_id \nQ2CBPJ58CA\n # Developer Portal Team ID\nitc_team_id \n18742801\n # iTunes Connect Team ID\n\n\n\n\nIf your project has different bundle identifiers per environment (i.e. beta, app store), you can define that by using \nfor_platform\n and/or \nfor_lane\n block declaration.\n\n\napp_identifier \nnet.sunapps.1\n\napple_id \nfelix@krausefx.com\n\nteam_id \nQ2CBPJ58CC\n\n\nfor_platform :ios do\n  team_id '123' # for all iOS related things\n  for_lane :test do\n    app_identifier 'com.app.test'\n  end\nend\n\n\n\n\nYou only have to use \nfor_platform\n if you're using \nplatform [platform_name] do\n in your \nFastfile\n.\n\n\nfastlane\n will always use the lane specific value if given, otherwise fall back to the value on the top of the file. Therefore, while driving the \n:test\n lane, this configuration is loaded:\n\n\napp_identifier \ncom.app.test\n\napple_id \nfelix@krausefx.com\n\nteam_id \n123\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing from fastlane\n\n\nIf you want to access those values from within your \nFastfile\n use\n\n\nidentifier = CredentialsManager::AppfileConfig.try_fetch_value(:app_identifier)\nteam_id = CredentialsManager::AppfileConfig.try_fetch_value(:team_id)\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Actions\n\n\nUsing FastlaneCore::Configuration\n\n\nMost actions accept one or more parameters to customize their behavior. Actions define their\nparameters in an \navailable_options\n method. This method returns an array of \nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem\n\nobjects to describe supported options. Each option is declared by creating a new\n\nConfigItem\n, e.g.:\n\n\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :file,\n  env_name: \nMY_NEW_ACTION_FILE\n,\n  description: \nA file to operate on\n,\n  type: String,\n  optional: false\n)\n\n\n\n\nThis declares a \nfile\n option for use with the action in a Fastfile, e.g.:\n\n\nmy_new_action(file: \nfile.txt\n)\n\n\n\n\nIf the optional \nenv_name\n is present, an environment variable with the specified\nname may also be used in place of an option in the Fastfile:\n\n\nMY_NEW_ACTION_FILE=file.txt fastlane run my_new_action\n\n\n\n\nThe \ntype\n argument to the \nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem\n initializer specifies the\nname of a Ruby class representing a standard\ndata type. Supplied arguments will be coerced to the specified type. Some standard types\nsupport default conversions.\n\n\nBoolean parameters\n\n\nRuby does not have a single class to represent a Boolean type. When specifying\nBoolean parameters, use \nis_string: false\n, without specifying a \ntype\n, e.g.:\n\n\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :commit,\n  env_name: \nMY_NEW_ACTION_COMMIT\n,\n  description: \nCommit the results if true\n,\n  optional: true,\n  default_value: false,\n  is_string: false\n)\n\n\n\n\nWhen passing a string value, e.g. from an environment variable, certain set\nstring values are recognized:\n\n\nMY_NEW_ACTION_COMMIT=true\nMY_NEW_ACTION_COMMIT=false\nMY_NEW_ACTION_COMMIT=yes\nMY_NEW_ACTION_COMMIT=no\n\n\n\n\nThese values may also be passed in all caps, e.g. \nMY_NEW_ACTION_COMMIT=YES\n.\n\n\nArray parameters\n\n\nIf a parameter is declared with \ntype: Array\n and a \nString\n argument is passed,\nan array will be produced by splitting the string using the comma character\nas a delimiter:\n\n\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :files,\n  env_name: \nMY_NEW_ACTION_FILES\n,\n  description: \nOne or more files to operate on\n,\n  type: Array,\n  optional: false\n)\n\n\n\n\nmy_new_action(files: \nfile1.txt,file2.txt\n)\n\n\n\n\nThis is received by the action as \n[\"file1.txt\", \"file2.txt\"]\n.\n\n\nThis also means a parameter that accepts an array may take a single string as an\nargument:\n\n\nmy_new_action(files: \nfile.txt\n)\n\n\n\n\nThis is received by the action as \n[\"file.txt\"]\n.\n\n\nComma-separated lists are particularly useful when using environment variables:\n\n\nexport MY_NEW_ACTION_FILES=file1.txt,file2.txt\n\n\n\n\nPolymorphic parameters\n\n\nTo allow for different types to be passed to a parameter (beyond what is\nprovided above), specify \nis_string: false\n without a \ntype\n field. Use\nan optional \nverify_block\n argument (see below) or verify the argument within\nyour action. If the block does not raise, the option is considered verified.\nThe \nUI.user_error!\n method is a convenient way to handle verification failure.\n\n\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :polymorphic_option,\n  is_string: false,\n  verify_block: -\n(value) { verify_option(value) }\n)\n\ndef verify_option(value)\n  case value\n  when String\n    @polymorphic_option = value\n  when Array\n    @polymorphic_option = value.join(\n \n)\n  when Hash\n    @polymorphic_option = value.to_s\n  else\n    UI.user_error! \nInvalid option: #{value.inspect}\n\n  end\nend\n\n\n\n\nCallback parameters\n\n\nIf your action needs to provide a callback, specify \nProc\n for the \ntype\n field.\n\n\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :callback,\n  description: \nOptional callback argument\n,\n  optional: true,\n  type: Proc\n)\n\n\n\n\nTo invoke the callback in your action, use the \nProc#call\n method and pass\nany arguments:\n\n\nparams[:callback].call(result) if params[:callback]\n\n\n\n\nTo notify the user of success or failure, it's usually best just to return a\nvalue such as \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n from your action. Use a callback for contextual\nerror handling. For example, the built-in \nsh\n action passes the entire command\noutput to an optional \nerror_callback\n:\n\n\ncallback = lambda do |result|\n  handle_missing_file if result =~ /file not found/i\n  handle_auth_failure if result =~ /login failed/i\nend\n\nsh \nsome_cmd\n, error_callback: callback\n\n\n\n\nNote on Procs\n\n\nWhen passing a block as a parameter to an action or ConfigItem, use\na Proc object. There are three ways to create an instance of Proc in Ruby.\n\n\nUsing the \nlambda\n operator:\n\n\nverify_block = lambda do |value|\n  ...\nend\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nProc.new\n:\n\n\nverify_block = Proc.new do |value|\n  ...\nend\n\n\n\n\nUsing the \nProc\n literal notation:\n\n\nverify_block = -\n(value) { ... }\n\n\n\n\nNote that you cannot pass a block literal as a \nProc\n.\n\n\nVerify blocks\n\n\nUse a \nverify_block\n argument with your \nConfigItem\n to provide special\nargument verification:\n\n\nverify_block = lambda do |value|\n  # Has to be a String to get this far\n  uri = URI(value)\n  UI.error \nInvalid scheme #{uri.scheme}\n unless uri.scheme == \nhttp\n || uri.scheme == \nhttps\n\nend\n\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :url,\n  type: String,\n  verify_block: verify_block\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe \nverify_block\n requires a \nProc\n argument (see above).\n\n\nConflicting options\n\n\nIf your action includes multiple conflicting options, use \nconflicting_options\n\nin the \nConfigItem\n for each. Make sure conflicting options are optional.\n\n\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :text,\n  type: String,\n  optional: true,\n  conflicting_options: [:text_file]\n),\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :text_file,\n  type: String,\n  optional: true,\n  conflicting_options: [:text]\n)\n\n\n\n\nYou can also pass a \nconflict_block\n (a \nProc\n, see above) if you want to\nimplement special handling of conflicting options:\n\n\nconflict_block = Proc.new do |other|\n  UI.user_error! \nUnexpected conflict with option #{other}\n unless [:text, :text_file].include?(other)\n  UI.message \nIgnoring :text_file in favor of :text\n\nend\n\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :text,\n  type: String,\n  optional: true,\n  conflicting_options: [:text_file],\n  conflict_block: conflict_block\n),\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :text_file,\n  type: String,\n  optional: true,\n  conflicting_options: [:text],\n  conflict_block: conflict_block\n)\n\n\n\n\nOptional parameters\n\n\nParameters with \noptional: true\n will be \nnil\n unless a \ndefault_value\n field\nis present. Make sure the \ndefault_value\n is reasonable unless it's acceptable\nfor the key to be absent.\n\n\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :build_configuration,\n  description: \nWhich build configuration to use\n,\n  type: String,\n  optional: true,\n  default_value: \nRelease\n\n),\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :offset,\n  description: \nOffset to start from\n,\n  type: Integer,\n  optional: true,\n  default_value: 0\n),\nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem.new(\n  key: :workspace,\n  description: \nOptional workspace path\n,\n  type: String,\n  optional: true\n  # Not every project has a workspace, so nil is a good default value here.\n)\n\n\n\n\nWithin the action \nparams[:build_configuration]\n will never be nil. Specifying\nthe \ndefault_value\n is preferable to something in code like:\n\n\nconfig = params[:build_configuration] || \nRelease\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault values are included in the documentation for action parameters.\n\n\nConfiguration files\n\n\nMany built-in actions such as \ndeliver\n, \ngym\n and \nscan\n support configuration files\n(\nDeliverfile\n, \nGymfile\n, \nScanfile\n). This is useful for actions with many options.\nTo add support for a configuration file to a custom action, call \nload_configuration_file\n\nearly, usually as the first line of \nrun\n:\n\n\ndef self.run(params)\n  params.load_configuration_file(\nMyNewActionfile\n)\n  # ...\n\n\n\n\nThis will load any parameters specified in \nMyNewActionfile\n. This method looks for\nthe specified file in \n./fastlane\n, \n./.fastlane\n and \n.\n, in that order. The\nfile is evaluated by the Ruby interpreter.\nYou may specify they \nkey\n from any \nFastlaneCore::ConfigItem\n as a method call in the\nconfiguration file:\n\n\ncommand \nls -la\n\nfiles %w{file1.txt file2.txt}\n\n\n\n\nResolution order\n\n\nParameters are resolved from different sources in the following order:\n\n\n\n\nA parameter directly passed to an action using the \nkey\n, usually from the\n    \nFastfile\n.\n\n\nAn environment variable, if the \nenv_name\n is set.\n\n\nA configuration file used in \nload_configuration_file\n.\n\n\nThe \ndefault_value\n of the \nConfigItem\n. If not explicitly set, this will be\n    \nnil\n.\n\n\n\n\nUser input and output\n\n\nThe \nFastlaneCore::UI\n utility may be used to display output to the user and also\nrequest input from an action.\n\nUI\n includes a number of methods to customize the output for different purposes:\n\n\nUI.message \nHello from my_new_action.\n\nUI.important \nWarning: This is a new action.\n\nUI.error \nSomething unexpected happened in my_new_action. Attempting to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmethod\n\n\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerror\n\n\nDisplays an error message in red\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimportant\n\n\nDisplays a warning or other important message in yellow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuccess\n\n\nDisplays a success message in green\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmessage\n\n\nDisplays a message in the default output color\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeprecated\n\n\nDisplays a deprecation message in bold blue\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommand\n\n\nDisplays a command being executed in cyan\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommand_output\n\n\nDisplays command output in magenta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nverbose\n\n\nDisplays verbose output in the default output color\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheader\n\n\nDisplays a message in a box for emphasis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods ending in an exclamation point (\n!\n) terminate execution of the current\nlane and report an error:\n\n\nUI.user_error! \nCould not open file #{file_path}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmethod\n\n\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncrash!\n\n\nReport a catastrophic error\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser_error!\n\n\nRescue an exception in your action and report a nice message to the user\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshell_error!\n\n\nReport failure of a shell command\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbuild_failure!\n\n\nReport a build failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntest_failure!\n\n\nReport a test failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabort_with_message!\n\n\nReport a failure condition that prevents continuing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that these methods raise exceptions that are rescued in the runner context for\nthe lane.

You can\neasily determine the exit status of the command and capture all terminal output\nfrom the command.\n\n\nUsing Kernel#system\n\n\nUse the Ruby \nsystem\n method call to invoke a command string. This does not\nredirect stdin, stdout or stderr, so output formatting will be unaffected. It executes\nthe command in a subshell.\n\n\nsystem \ncat fastlane/Fastfile\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon command completion, the method returns true or false to indicate completion\nstatus. The \n$?\n global variable will also indicate the exit status of the\ncommand.\n\n\nsystem \ncat fastlane/Fastfile\n\nUI.user_error! \nCould not execute command\n unless $?.exitstatus == 0\n\n\n\n\nIf the command to be executed is not found, system will return \nnil\n, and\n\n$?.exitstatus\n will be nonzero.\n\n\nUsing backticks\n\n\nTo capture the output of a command, enclose the command in backticks:\n\n\npod_cmd = `which pod`\nUI.important \n'pod' command not found\n if pod_cmd.empty?\n\n\n\n\nBecause you are capturing stdout, the command output will not appear at\nthe terminal unless you log it using \nUI\n. Formatting may be lost when\ncapturing command output. The entire output to stdout will be captured after the\ncommand returns. Output to stderr is not captured or redirected. The \n$?\n\nglobal variable will indicate the completion status of the command.\n\n\nIf the command to be executed is not found, \nErrno::ENOENT\n is raised.\n\n\nUsing the sh method\n\n\nYou can also use the built-in \nsh\n method:\n\n\nsh \npwd\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is called the same way in an action as in a Fastfile. This provides consistent\nlogging of command output. All output to stdout and stderr is logged via \nUI\n.\n\n\nThe \nsh\n method can accept a block, which will receive the \nProcess::Status\n\nreturned by the command, the complete output of the command, and an equivalent\nshell command upon completion of the command.\n\n\nsh \nls\n, \n-la\n do |status, result, command|\n  unless status.success?\n    UI.error \nCommand #{command} (pid #{status.pid}) failed with status #{status.exitstatus}\n\n  end\n  UI.message \nOutput is #{result.inspect}\n\nend\n\n\n\n\nTo be notified only when an error occurs, use the \nerror_callback\n parameter\n(a Proc):\n\n\nsuccess = true\nsh(\npwd\n, error_callback: -\n(result) { success = false })\nUI.user_error \nCommand failed\n unless success\n\n\n\n\nThe \nresult\n argument to the \nerror_callback\n is the entire string output\nof the command.\n\n\nIf the command to be executed is not found, \nErrno::ENOENT\n is raised without\ncalling the block or \nerror_callback\n.\n\n\nIf an \nerror_callback\n or block is not provided, and the command executes and\nreturns an error, an exception is raised, and lane execution is terminated\nunless the exception is rescued. The exit status of the command will be available in \n$?\n. It is also available\nas the first argument to a block.\n\n\nThe return value of the method is the output of the command, unless a block is\ngiven. Then the output is available within the block, and the return value of\n\nsh\n is the return value of the block. This enables usage like:\n\n\nif sh command { |s| s.success? }\n  UI.success \nCommand succeeded\n\nelse\n  UI.error \nCommand failed\n\nend\n\n\n\n\nAnywhere other than an action or a Fastfile (e.g. in helper code), you can\ninvoke this method as \nActions.sh\n.\n\n\nEscaping in shell commands\n\n\nUse \nshellwords\n to escape arguments to shell commands.\n\n\n`git commit -aqm #{Shellwords.escape commit_message}`\n\n\n\n\nsystem \ncat #{path.shellescape}\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using \nsystem\n or \nsh\n, pass a list of arguments instead of shell-escaping\nindividual arguments.\n\n\nsh \ngit\n, \ncommit\n, \n-aqm\n, commit_message\nsystem \ncat\n, path\n\n\n\n\nCalling other actions\n\n\nSome built-in utility actions, such as \nsh\n, may be used in custom actions (e.g., in\nplugins). It's not generally a good idea to call a complex action from another action.\nIn particular:\n\n\n\n\nIf you're calling one plugin action from another plugin action, you should\n  probably refactor your plugin helper to be more easily called from all actions\n  in the plugin.\n\n\nAvoid wrapping complex built-in actions like \ndeliver\n and \ngym\n.\n\n\nThere can be issues with one plugin depending on another plugin.\n\n\nCertain simple built-in utility actions may be used with \nother_action\n in your\n  action, such as: \nother_action.git_add\n, \nother_action.git_commit\n.\n\n\nThink twice before calling an action from another action.
